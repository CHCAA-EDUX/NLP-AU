# Natural Language Processing - Fall 2021

This repository contains all of the code and data related to the Fall 2021 module _Natural Language Processing_ as part of the  [_kandidatuddannelsen_ in Cognitive Science](https://kandidat.au.dk/cognitivescience/) at Aarhus University.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis. 

## Technicalities

For the sake of convenience, I advise that everyone uses [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk) for development purposes. You can then clone this repo and pull any changes that are made on a weekly basis.

For those of you who do not wish to use UCloud, you are of course welcome to use your own machine. However, due to time constraints, we will not be providing any technical support if you choose to go this way. 

If you _still_ want to use your own machine, make sure to have _at least_ Python 3.7 installed. Some of the code developed in the classroom will not be backwards compatible with earlier versions of Python.

## Repo structure

This repository has been initialised with the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```src``` | A folder for Python scripts developed in class.
```syllabus```| Containing a markdown file with the course syllabus and readings


## Class times

Lectures take place on Wednesdays from 14-16; classroom instruction is on Thursday from 13-15. I'm not going to post the room number to Github - you can find this via the [AU Timetable](https://timetable.au.dk)

## Course overview and readings

A detailed breakdown of the course structure and the associated readings can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md). Also, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [_studieordning_](https://eddiprod.au.dk/EDDI/webservices/DokOrdningService.cfc?method=visGodkendtOrdning&dokOrdningId=14811&sprog=en) for the course, especially in relation to examination and academic regulations. 

Make sure to read the studieording first if you have any questions relating to the course organisation, exam format, and so forth.

## Contact details

Your lecturer for this course will be [Ross](au.dk/en/rdkm@cas); the classrooms will be led by [Kenneth](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kenneth-christian-enevoldsen(c52b8fd4-bd44-4c8e-997b-648715fd0d0d).html). If you have any problems with the course or questions that you want to ask, get in touch with Ross first

All communication to you will be sent _both_ on Slack _and_ via Blackboard. If you need to get in touch with Ross, Slack should be the first place to try - you'll likely get a quicker response!
