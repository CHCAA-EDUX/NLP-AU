# Class 1: The work stack
This class will take us through the work stack we will be using for natural language processing. This includes Slack, our channel for communications, Github for accessing code and for assignment hand-ins and Ucloud for accessing compute resources. Along Github we will also introduce unit testing with Github.

## Preparation for class

### Slack
You should all have recieved an invite to slack on Brightspace under the NLP class. You are expected to have set this up before class.

### Github
For the assigments and code materials for classes we will be using Github. If you are unfamiliar with Github spend some time before the class to familiarize yourself with it for instance using [the Github get started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). Another good place to start is the [module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-github-visual-studio-code/) on how to use Github with visual studio code.

For the class you are expected to:
- Have a Github account
- Being able to create a repository and
  - set up (clone) the repository for instance to a ucloud environment.
  - make changes and update the online repository (push/pull).
  - fork a repository.


### Ucloud
[Ucloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/) is a high performance computing platform and we introduced it during the Python workshop last week. i you weren't there I recommend you take a look at the platform before class. A good place to start is [the usage guide](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk).

### Pytest and testing
For the class we will introduce pytest and how to use it to automatically test code when pushing it to Github. To prepare to this go through chapter one ("Unit testing basics") of the course [Unit Testing for Data Science in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/unit-testing-for-data-science-in-python). Remember you can sign up for a free code camp license using the link on brightspace and your AU mail.

## Plan for class

- Quick introduction to the usage of Slack
  - What should be in there what should't
- Github
  - Creating a pull request (correcting content)
  - Creating an issue (giving instant feedback)
  - Continuous integration with pytest and Github actions
- Introduction to the first assignment


<!-- 
## Assigment 1 

- submitting the neural network
  - test:
    - test that it is able to memorize random 10 examples
    - generalize it to take an input of range(n, n+5) and return n, where n is a whole number between 0 and 2
      - you might need to scale the input
    - Classify more than 90% of digit correctly
  - If you werent there for day 3 of the workshop feel free to use the "answer code", but you might need to read chapter 1-2 in the book.
