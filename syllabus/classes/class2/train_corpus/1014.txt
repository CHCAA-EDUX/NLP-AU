Reasonable rate. We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos. He knows his bees! Suzanne, Vancouver Very Accomodating We were in Springfield, IL for a family funeral from Kansas City. We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in. The rooms were very clean, including the microwave and refrigerator. This is a nice place, and I know we will return to meet my sister-in-law from Chicago!! GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE!!
