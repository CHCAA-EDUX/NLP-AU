Rabbits do burrow also so don't be surprised if chicken are falling into holes. rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that. melting brass did not work? my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures. we have made a furnace as such, we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom, filled the pipe with brass scrap, surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot, everything got red hot but did not melt. what am I doing wrong I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point. I'll just echo both other answers. Molten brass is damn hot and usually it's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen. Even if you did melt it, I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it.
