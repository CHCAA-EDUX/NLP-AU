In any case, we have had some more time to do some exploring (and shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come. I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing (which will take only a few minutes, actually), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving. We'll do whatever you want want if you still are coming! Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's going on in Houston.
