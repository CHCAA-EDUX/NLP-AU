Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for Enron's motion to compel. As you may recall, they say they want a deposition on the parties' intention. We should be expecting a deposition notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat. I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the Trustee is seeking. As you see below, she is pulling those together. Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer. Thanks. Hi-- Talked to Craig and the Court today. The motion to compel is now scheduled for Dec. 12 at 2p.m.
