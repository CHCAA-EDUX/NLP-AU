What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing? I use GIMP and Its not cutting it, looks terrible. Here's one of my shots in B&W http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamtolle/6094960940/in/set-72157627535453128/ Any programs that you use please list :) Thx You could also try this in gimp. It will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks: Open your image while it's still in color Create a new layer and fill the later with black. Set the layer mode to "color" this will make your image blak and white.
