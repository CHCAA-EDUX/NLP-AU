he has been "biting" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time. any answers help!!!!!! you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough. you need to do that for a least a week, or else this type of territorial fighting will happen. giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared. right now, your male is fighting off an intruder, and he feels that all of the house is his. put her back in the room, and keep the door closed for a week. then let her out for ten minutes. make it fifteen the next day, then twenty, and so on. this will do two things; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room, making it her territory.
