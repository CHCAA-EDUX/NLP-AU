The drugs and arms travel in all directions. Since the "Sea Tigers" of the LTTE, better known as the Tamil Tigers, are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea: they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa. It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa. This is not unknown to New Delhi. A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair, in the Andamans, quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands, using fake Indian ration cards, while citizens of Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave. "Port Blair, Havelock Islands, Diglipur, Middle Nicobar, Campbell's Bay, Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners," he said. An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50,000 "foreigners" in the Andaman Islands, but unofficial figures are much higher than this. A large number of them are Bangladeshis, who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere. As most of them have few technical skills, and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case, they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities. The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns, cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous.
