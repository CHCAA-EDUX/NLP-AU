However if you plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time they need company. My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results. It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand. These are the steps I used. Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets. Hopefully they will work for you. 1) When you get the bird, place him or her or them in the cage. Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours. 2) Then place you hand in the cage. I took the cage and place it next to the couch.
