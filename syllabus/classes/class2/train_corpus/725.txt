I have a western pleasure appy thats really heavy on her left lead at the lope? My appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope. She seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat... How could I work with her to get off her four hand,get balance, and lope smoothly and slowly?? Put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step, it's in the feeling when you feel her think trot, tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving. If you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant. Lope her to the left in circles, keep her head to the inside of the circle and push her but out, keep doing this if she breaks to a jog go a little bit bigger circle, till she can get enough balance to go small and small.circles my new OLYMPUS X940 DIGITAL CAMERA...? hi everyone....just hav my hands on my new OLYMPUS X940 digital camera..wel,i always wanted 2 hav one by sony..but anyways,ended up having olympus X940 from my dad.......does any1 already has it? how has ur experience with it?
