And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra (breathe in with Baba Nam, breathe out with Kevalam). Try this for 5 to 10 minutes. Now come back to earth again - slowly. Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully. Your muscles are loose and limp. Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again. The sun's rays and warmth are still with you, surrounding you. You are in a state of peace and relaxation. With each breath, watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace. Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body, warming you deeply and gently.
