I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa. do you have to go through a medical exam right away? drug test? blood test? or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates? i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country. I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute- which I really don't have the money for. I'm really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly. An American passport should get you right into the country, there is no need for a VISA, for six months. There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that.
