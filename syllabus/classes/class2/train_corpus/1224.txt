I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner. I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?! Bad for business. I was appalled. I will never recommend this gym to any woman. The equipment and classes aren't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff!!! There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500! The Salon Experience from Hell I feel obligated to share this story. Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation.
