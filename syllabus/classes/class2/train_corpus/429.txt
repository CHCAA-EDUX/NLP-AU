Please let us know if you need anything else. Thanks. Diane Goode Senior Specialist I agree also, but I don't know all the parties or complications involved. Should there be a (groan) meeting on this? Can you please help with this one? I agree with what the concern is below. We have GIS ids, and Eid (external id - just like GIS id). I think we should try to migrate to one of these. Please let me know what type of statement I should make back to the customer.
