They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them. Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed. They dont want to be held or touched. I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks. I still have them and they are doing well. A couple of months after I got parakeets/budgies. They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality. I love them. First of all they are very tame. I tamed them in 4 days.
