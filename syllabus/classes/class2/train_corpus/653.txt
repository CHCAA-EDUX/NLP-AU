About 30 seconds into his address, he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time. Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk. Even he can't believe that he is trotting out this old saw again. I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once, you can't help but trot it out every time your act is going sour. Meanwhile, every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again. The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries, when what he should do is pour money into making the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together. We have the technology; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "FREEDOM" why not spend those billions making all of us free? Free of polution, free of oil dependency, and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good (theirs). I'm sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off. In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave.
