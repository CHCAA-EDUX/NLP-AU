Thank you Doctor Gonzales, Doctor Stout, Eva Marie and the entire staff! Rocky M. Lange Retired Coordinator, Clark County School District HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD not only is this place too expensive for what it is, its horrible! In the past, I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak (and this was the sirloin!), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side. Today we went for a party (during lunch, so the place was empty) with about 25 other people. It took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it! Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad? I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others, as I was the last to get my food. I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here.
