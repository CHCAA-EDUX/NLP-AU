Visualize the vivid, beautiful colours of the earth (its flowers and plants), the sea next to you, and the sky above you. Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea. As you sit above the world, the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer. It surrounds you. The golden rays feel soft and soothing. Now you are far above the earth - into space. Everything around you is so vast. Yet, there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness. You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you. Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness.
