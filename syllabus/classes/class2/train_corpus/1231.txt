No one will give me a date. I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor. Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer. How do you lose a drawer. After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings, Boyles, the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned. The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture. So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite. I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse. Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service. Excellent Driving School
