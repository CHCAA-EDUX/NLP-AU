Shop local at Exile!! Over-rated Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr, but that doesn't impress me. The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but, the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries. The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been, acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers. The angry lobster was completely over-priced! $80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables! I wouldn't go there again. Alto delivers on all levels. From the moment you enter the restaurant, you know you are some place special.
