When the males aggressive behavior stops, it is ready to spawn. The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them. Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees Please help with my cats bladder issue? I have a 1 1/2 year old female calico. When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney. Recently she has been peeing A LOT. I'm talking soaking all the litter box and then some. She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath. I don't have the money to take her to a vet right now but it's getting to be an issue.
