I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents. As much fun as they are, I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them. As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people). But, we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc. In one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read. Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well. Hopefully, if we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit. I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair that is a U.T. game). Things in Houston are good and definitely warm. I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.
