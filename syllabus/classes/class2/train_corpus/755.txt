anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience. I want to go all over :) I don't have a set route yet. Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket. Wool is best. Light ,warm, but also itchy. Hit the road. You can always beg for spare change when you get hungry. Should get some survival skills before setting out on your own. Vietnamese girl's name, Mayko? I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name.
