In Agra I've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended, they found it in the Rough Guide. It was nice and close to the Taj. It was quite easy to find something. (Dont stay in Agra too long. One night is enough!) There were many hotels there. Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean. Good luck, enjoy your time! You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned, the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra. http://www.goldentriangleindia.com/delhi/hotels-in-delhi.html
