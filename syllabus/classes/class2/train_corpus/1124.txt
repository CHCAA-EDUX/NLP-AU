Tiffany is fabulous! I came in for alterations (free, by the way) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse. She immediately went to the back, brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot. I didn't even buy the bag there! Huge selection and, great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don't have what you need. We were expecting a great experience, when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts. The atmosphere was nice and very clean. The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters. The service was ok, our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times. To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde, it was completly flavorless.
