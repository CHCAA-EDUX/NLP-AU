The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes, it's one of Victor Bout's. The wikipedia entry for Aerocom is just a stub .. waiting for someone to put some information into it.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerocom So... put some information in there. You know, nature hates a void. :) Richard, i agree, Hmmmmmm. How are chants of death and suicide ... morality. What about Manson's tees bearing the message, "Kill your parents". And were the Columbine killers acting out this "real morality" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates.
