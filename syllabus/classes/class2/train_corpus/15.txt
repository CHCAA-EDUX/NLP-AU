But Sharon's iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza. Sharon's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further, which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States. Israel owes the United States at least this much, in this crisis, to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace. 3) Make Iraq another Afghanistan, using the Republican Right's own tactics against them. Response: Iraq is actually hostile territory for al-Qaeda, and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there. By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives, the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners. Certainly, the Shiites already hate al-Qaeda and would help; likewise the Kurds. The problem of mollifying the Sunnis, though, has to be solved to avoid giving al-Qaeda an entr√©e. The Americans have to put away their free-market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households. We need an FDR in Iraq, not a Ronald Reagan.
