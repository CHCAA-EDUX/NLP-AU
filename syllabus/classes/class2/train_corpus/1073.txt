[no homo] :D friendly, fine food The one-star review from 2005 is out of date. There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly. The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches, homemade soups, fresh salads. The atmosphere may not be for everyone. It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table (as in many European cafes), but if you are OK with that, the food is very good. Love the soups.
