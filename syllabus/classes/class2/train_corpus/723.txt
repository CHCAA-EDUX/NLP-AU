you are best to either recover to the standard ROM, or find one that doesn't crash. cynangon mod should work. Have you tried using clockwork recovery? Get the older version of Cynagon mod. Also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake. Those roms focus on speed and stability. Or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement. I would recommend go launcher or adw launcher. They are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit. As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom.
