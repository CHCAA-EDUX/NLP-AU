Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s campaign against warlords. At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively, the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post, spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran. Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand. However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran. ‘’We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters,’’ says Barno. Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran. ‘’Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran. So far what they have done together has been good for us and that’s how we would like to keep it’’, says Karzai. Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan’s neighbours is over, but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours’ interference. In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns.
