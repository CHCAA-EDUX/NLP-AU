i have tried "braining" both live and dead pinkies, and bloodying them up to get his attention, but he doesn't care. i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice, and in used gerbil bedding. i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake's face. he wont even try to bite. i am very discouraged and sad and i don't know what to do. he hasn't eaten in an entire month. i've only tried to feed him one at a time. he's just a tiny baby, about the width of a pencil. do babies this small hibernate? When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him?
