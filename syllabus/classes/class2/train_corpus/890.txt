&Also how much money would I need? So I can start saving now hehe Thanks :) I mean when I graduate & yes, college, sorry for the typo. Leave High School? Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you've never traveled before and you don't put where you would be traveling from. In the United States? Lots of places.

There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific.
