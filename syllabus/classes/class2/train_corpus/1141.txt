They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $175 just to diagnose the problem! Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing. I walked away. So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER. STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. Perfect Practice After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish. Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself, putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process, both initially and then as we went along. Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them. The surgery itself is slick, modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands.
