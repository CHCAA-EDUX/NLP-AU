However, during the test, they did whatever they can to get my test failed. Then, they sold me overpriced stuffs, such as oil tank cap, so that my car can pass it right away. I ended up paying much more. Are you kidding me? I don't get it. Spongy and sweet bread (microwaved?), heartless salsa, tiny dogs... You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt. The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude. If this is the best that Tucson has to offer, I am outta here... I called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache.
