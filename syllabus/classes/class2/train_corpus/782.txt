Oh my gosh, they are great! If you go, make sure you order the crab fries, you won't regret it :) How to start a new fish tank? I'm getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up. I'm still a beginner. Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help. Thanks. When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside (with plain water) then you wash the gravel (with only water too) take out all the stuff that is floating on top. Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins. You add the water and put water conditioner into the water.
