Favorite place in Tampa. Update: I had to add to my review. I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room. AMAZING! I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch. Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "new" dining room. Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went. We were greeted again and sat promptly. After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had, we knew we were in for a treat! I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner.
