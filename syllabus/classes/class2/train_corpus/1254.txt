Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but I'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal. The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't seem to be any sort of management that I could see. I will never return there again (and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car).
