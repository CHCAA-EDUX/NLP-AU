Kay - Can you please review this additional language to the risk management policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge)? In light of the CA regarding curves, I am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples unlimited access to information. I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have. Let me know what you think. Thanks, Gregg m.nordstrom@pecorp.com 10/20/2000 11:32 AM Attached please find the latest enovate risk policy.
