Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel. Ken PS Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan. I will put this on our calendars. Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing, but maybe next year. San Antonio, wow what a let down from the other cities. That will be a nice time of year though. I can recommend some good restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday. We stayed at the Menger and had a great time. Kay Mann@ENRON
