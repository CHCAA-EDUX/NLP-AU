try to train him to heel, which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash, and he may do that. or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably, if you act quick enough, will stay on the leash. What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi/Agra/Varanasi for rs500 per night? Hey guys. I'm looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night. There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000, close to the centre of these cities. This would be on a walk-in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good (Not relying on pictures from the internet) and is in a spot we like. Thanks in advance for sharing your experience! Sorry, almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk-in to these hotels rather than pre book? In Delhi I'd recommend Ajay Guesthouse.
