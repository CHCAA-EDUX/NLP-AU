HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous. HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys. Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator. Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later (as they can with e-mail). This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned. The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but they lack commercial sponsorship. They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide. Please let us know if you have additional questions. - er Steven J Kean
