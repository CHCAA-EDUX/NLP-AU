FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way. Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale, purchase and returns was never easy before. How long does it take to train new people at work ? Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day's training How fast your support queries get answered ? Over telephone, immediate. On call, it takes a day to get our issues resolved. Can't wait to go back!!! This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at! We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at. We could not have been more welcomed, more comfortable or more well fed.
