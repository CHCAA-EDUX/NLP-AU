While there wasn't too much available for their age (ball pit, bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there, so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there. It's not the classiest place, but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly. For $4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler. Restored my faith in Mechaincs. I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should. I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal. They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more. The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning. I cannot say enough about this place. They have restored my faith in Mechanics.
