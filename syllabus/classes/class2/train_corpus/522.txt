11/28/2000 07:35 PM Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here. I've read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately. Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed?? We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims. It settled anyway, a long time ago. mb Michelle, Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India?
