Lee Huber made the same request last year and we gave her the chair (she only wanted one, however). Norma, any thoughts? DENISE LAGESSE 01/12/2001 01:14 PM Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her offices - on 47 and 41. This particular chair is designed to help with back problems, which she has. Many people at Enron already have this type of chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular. The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax. Please approve the purchase of two. Thanks!
