To add insult to injury, he refused to refund our money. Don't go! FHS is a good high school -- c/o 1998 I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School. We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs, with multiple hoods and access to good equipment; nice gymnasiums, and a well-funded music department (I was in the guitar ensemble). Now, of course, there's a new building, with presumably better facilities. All to the good. For those who care, a good proportion of the my class went on to 4-year colleges, many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News. If I remember, students went to Dartmouth, U.Penn, Duke, BU, William and Mary, Vassar, Howard, and Carnegie Mellon, among others. Many students went to Rutgers, including their top-ranked pharmacy program.
