This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats. Both are equal length so go for the taller one. If you use this cage it's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like. I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it doesn't last very well. Here are some better options IMO: http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/mamble-hamster-narrow-100cm-cage-p-12642.html http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/abode-large-metal-cage-liberta-free-delivery-p-6679.html http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/savic-freddy-cage-free-delivery-p-6750.html http://www.netpetshop.co.uk/p-19500-savic-chichi-2-chinchilla-rat-degu-ferret-cage.aspx http://www.justcages.co.uk/ferret-cages/ferplast-furet-plus-ferret-cage#v_431
