It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard, got myself a woman like Jerry, and became a republican. Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation! Pho-nomenal!! I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown, but when i tried this pho place, it blew the other pho houses away!! all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price. The service here is incredible compared to the other places. the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown. remember to bring cash since they don't take debit or credit. hope this helps!! Had a horrible experience with a manager here, Rachel McInnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly...
