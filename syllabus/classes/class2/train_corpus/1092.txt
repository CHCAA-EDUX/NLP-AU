I did the work myself for $50. There's no excuse for that kind of estimate. My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn't want to wait in line at Outback. What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM. #1 its immaculately clean. #2 the decor is tasteful and artistic, from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures.... and (most importantly) #3 the food is FANTASTIC. This is authentic Cuban cuisine; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly. The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant. TRY THIS PLACE - YOU'LL LOVE IT. Thank you for helping me get more healthy!
