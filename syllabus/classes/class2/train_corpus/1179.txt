I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too. I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts. The owner, Jean, has been there 31 years! What a history. She is a super sweet, lovable and well-informed woman with a great sense of humor. I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl. This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter. By the way, Salmagundi (the store name) means something like smorgasbord; potpourri; motley; variety; mixed bag; miscellaneous assortment; mixture, a variety of many kinds of things. Great name for a great store! Shop Local!
