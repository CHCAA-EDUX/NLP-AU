I finally alerted him to his rudeness. He said he's had a long and bad day. We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can. Don't stay there. I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also. My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening. We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night. Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this. My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her. They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.
