I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren't the cheapest I found but very reasonable. The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures. They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy. We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over- who would have guessed that one? Very nice work and friendly guys too. Best money I've spent on remodeling ever. I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call.
