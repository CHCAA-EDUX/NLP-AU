Texas Roadhouse is WAY better!! Spay and neuter service. I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful. But I had my cat spayed through their reduced/free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away, and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections. My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery, So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit. You'd think they would do a good job but they don't care unless they are getting paid full price. Which is so dumb. Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery. Billing Issues... I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail.
