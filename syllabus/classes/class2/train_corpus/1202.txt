It was a black female that use to work in the office. She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work. The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it. Thats how they were caught. They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments. The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers. Nobody lived there. A girl would show up, then a guy in a nice car would show up. Short time later the guy would leave, then the girl. My apartment was usually quiet.
