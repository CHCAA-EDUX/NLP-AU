01/19/2001 07:24 AM Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today. I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning. I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch. Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel. Ken PS Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan. Jeff, here is the intial draft. Please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that you think necessary.
