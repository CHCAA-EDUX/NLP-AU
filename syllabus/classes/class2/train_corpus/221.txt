Darla Ok to book for me and my husband, Joseph. I was issued a new corporate American Express card. Same number with expiration date of 3/03. If you need any more info, please advise. Otherwise, I will assume you will book the two tickets. Thank you. Actually-upon second look the deal number is 814014-why can't you see this? Did you do a deal with National Fuel Marketing purchasing 3,500 mmbtu on May 30th @2.975? They are invoicing for this and I don't have an invoice for it.
