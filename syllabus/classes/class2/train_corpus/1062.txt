Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever. I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired, I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors You will be happy at this store! Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula. The store manager, Jim Smith, made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus. Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns. The store is clean, run very professionally and a pleasure to be in. They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right. Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car! Excellent service, Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch.
