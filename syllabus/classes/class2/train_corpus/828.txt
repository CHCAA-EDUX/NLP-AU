You can't MAKE them mate, you can only encourage them. Ian Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed. Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other. Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3-5 days. The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish, or a few of them, but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in. The p H should be 6.5-7. Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms, blackworms and/or earthworms as it can eat for 3-5 days. Then add the other mate. They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked.
