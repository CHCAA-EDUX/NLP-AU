The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman. In other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help. However upon our arrival no one there (the inn was open). So no totes. Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M, no exceptions. Then she was gone. We returned after 3PM, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room. Rules in the room: #1) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash. If they think you've taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you $1.50 per can. They count the cans in the trash to make sure.
