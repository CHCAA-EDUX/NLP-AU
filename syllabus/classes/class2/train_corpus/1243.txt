So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!! STAY AWAY!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!! When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion! Lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it. I called the "207" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up. I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates. They had a room with a $99 rate, which I booked. The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.
