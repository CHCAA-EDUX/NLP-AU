Thanks, Kim. Kim Has a location, Theirs or TW land/ROW, been settled and when is the required in-service date? Thanks Earl Chanley 505-625-8031 All, Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar. I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft. It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar. Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.
