Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont. Staff is under educated. Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money. Over priced for students to learn! Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon!!! BEWARE! You can fool people This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising. They convince lots of people that they are a great store, when in fact they are a very average place at best, they are just another big box store like the others. They offer sales that aren't really sales, mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn't, a bad attitude about return items, and on and on.
