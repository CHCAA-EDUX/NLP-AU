Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly. Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also. In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai, Iran, Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai. Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream. Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai. However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same. With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced. However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates. Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand, a massive Soviet-era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran’s border. The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan, the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month, who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners.
