Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste, and this needs to be cleaned regularly, or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine. When you take a warm shower and build up steam, his cage will collect water, the bedding will absorb much of it, and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should. You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide-aways he may have. You also don't want it getting too warm for him too often. Overall, it is not a good solution, but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it. It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing. I would personally put him somewhere else. What is the most interesting place to see in South Korea?
