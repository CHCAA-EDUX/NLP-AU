She is crate trained, potty trained, and can sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw, and she wont get it until I give her the command. Yes, lots of time and lots of patients... I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog. She tosses me around like its nothing! ...but basically, what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy...lots of patience, lots of time, lots of praise, lots of treats, and lots of repition....Right? Is there any tricks I could use? Maybe get a book on training. You have to be in command at all times. There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out. I would start with a leash.
