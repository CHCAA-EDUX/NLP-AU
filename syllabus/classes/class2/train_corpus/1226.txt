He then "fixed" it for free but it still looked like crap. I will never go back. It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell. He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks. That's my favorite show of all time. I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around. Maybe he didn't do a good job and they told him so. Absolute Nightmare! STAY AWAY! Very unhappy ...
