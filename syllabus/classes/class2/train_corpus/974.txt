My other theory would be wobblers. I'll be having my equine chiro/acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him.... So any ideas? Think I should do it? Arby, Horse is out of state and not local. Owner is willing to meet me half way with him. I will be calling my vet and chiro about him. Worse comes to worse, I'm out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament. He's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle.
