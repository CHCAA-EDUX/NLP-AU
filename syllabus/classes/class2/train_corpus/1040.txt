This restaurant is over-rated. It is hard to find...and the mexican food is bland, almost equivalent to eating out of a can. The service is poor... I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas...and did not get it.! Secondly, the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce..but chili...like Hormel's chili..the cheese was American cheese! The Chili Relleno..had no batter on it. I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17. Mixed Tempura.....................8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad. I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size, to go box set up and quality of the food for the price. I'm very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again.
