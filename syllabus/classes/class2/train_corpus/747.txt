If you can't even do basic math, you'll never figure out how to use a DSLR camera properly. hey kido u made me smile does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air? its for a craft project.....i want to use it the way u would use icing.... took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact, if you are building up plaster ("the way you would icing") to do sculpting, which is rather uncommon, you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "mud" Plaster of Paris does two things - it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and - it dries out, losing the water that is soaked into the set structure For example, a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm#LGGOBPROJ Dwarf Hamster Making Too Much Noise On Wheel at Night?
