When they see that you arnt harming them, the will go up on your finger when you say up. 4) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying. Do not hit, yell, or harm them. You have patience. Dont give up! After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder, when I say up it means to jump up on my finger, when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage. and when I say go home it means to go in the cage. Good luck! They worked for me and I hope they worked for you! They are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
