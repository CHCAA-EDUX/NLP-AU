I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant, and I have to get a whole pie. I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC. Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around. I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL. I knew I had found the real deal, big pies, sold by the slice, with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front. They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano. So I ordered a slice. It tasted like I just flew back home. I dunno how they did it, but Scottish friends--- this is THE REAL DEAL. I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it.
