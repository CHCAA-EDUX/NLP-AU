Feel that you're sitting there in complete peace, right on top of the world. Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction. Feel you're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness. Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra: BABA NAM KEVALAM. Its meaning is "Infinite happiness is everywhere". Feel the meaning, don't just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit (BABA NAM KEVALAM) to an English meaning (Infinite peace and happiness). Think internally, intuitively, not by words, of the meaning, as you're repeating it. This is called ideation. It is important to take the idea, not just the intellectual analysis. Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process.
