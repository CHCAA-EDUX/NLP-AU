The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, Ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semi-sketchiness. Then one day, Ahmed left the country, not to return for months, WITHOUT informing me. He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in. The other person working at the store didn't know that I still had this table coming. I had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt/record of my purchase. I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation. I waited. And waited. He never once contacted us. I've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive.
