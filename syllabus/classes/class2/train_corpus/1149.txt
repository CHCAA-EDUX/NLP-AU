The other ladies had a similar experience, both had nail polish on a couple of toes. None of us will be using their services again, which is a shame. Good Service - Limited Results Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re: infertility. He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action. The office is shared with a foot doctor and it's very sterile and medical feeling, which I liked. The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients/doctors. I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs. The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles. I know it can take awhile for results and didn't expect a miracle, but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost/time.
