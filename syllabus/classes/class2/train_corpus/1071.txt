I have never had better service. My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia. They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time. Everyone was pleasant and very helpful. The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished. The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle. I give this dealer an A+! I will definitely be bringing my car back for service. HEAVEN ON EARTHHHHHHH!!!! MUST TRY!!!
