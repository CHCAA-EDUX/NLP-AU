Hi, Attached are Uecomm's final comments to the Master Agreement. John Suttle has OK'd Anthony's latest request w/r.t. the CSA. Could you please send an executable version of the contract to Fred, David, John and me tomorrow? If they're OK with it, we'd like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections. Thanks Pat Pat, Please find attached the Enron Master Agreement. I have inserted the company details of Uecomm as requested.
