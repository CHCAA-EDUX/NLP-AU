All of this started after their oil change. Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife's work and towed it back to fix it. I would not recommend this shop for anything, not even something as simple as an oil change. Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything, and smile while doing it. Liars, negative stars! Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy. The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg. However, they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings. I wonder if they were going down a hill! They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles.
