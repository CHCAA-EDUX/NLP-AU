Here are the four easy steps to success. STEP ONE: Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them. You now should have six sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!!!! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all.
