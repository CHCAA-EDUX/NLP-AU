It's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word. THX:-) The staff do occasionally get game info correct, but if your looking fot a good game and aren'ta nerd, dont ask them. The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps. I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn'ta fps. He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue. Overall they aren't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market.
