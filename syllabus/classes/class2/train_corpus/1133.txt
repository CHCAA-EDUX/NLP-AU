One of the worst places This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from. the food was horrible not cooked like it should be, they got the order wrong on a number of occasions, and once forgot about my order. i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady (who claimed to be a manager) said my food was on the way, and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way. i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold. in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector, and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant. Gone downhill since change in ownership Sigh. I used to LOVE this place. But now that they are part of a chain, service has slipped.
