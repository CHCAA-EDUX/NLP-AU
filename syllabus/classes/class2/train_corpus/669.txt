<<Doctor RODERIGO LOPEZ (1525 -1594) was the Portugese Jewish doctor accused by Essex of trying to poison Queen Elizabeth. The 69 year old Dr. Lopez was found guilty and was summarily hung and quartered on June 7, 1594 at Tyburn. Long before (September 1560) Dr. Lopez had been the personal house doctor of Robert Dudley and the good doctor was obligated to write the death certificate for Amy Robsart (stating that she had "accidentally" fallen down the stairs). That same year (1560) a Spanish priest named RUY LOPEZ handily beat all comers at a chess tournament in Rome. Lopez's 1561 book "Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del Juego del Acedraz" became THE classic on Chess openings, including the one that bears his name. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Chess history 1530-1647 [ ] 1530 LOPEZ, Ruy b. in Zafra, Spain.
