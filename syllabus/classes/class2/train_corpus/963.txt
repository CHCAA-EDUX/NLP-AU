We had a ball. We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend. There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted. The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones. The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities. There is a splash fountain (no standing water) for little ones still in diapers; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained; Then a family pool; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed. You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise. If you stay with your dining schedule, every night is dinner and a show. The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise. Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare.
