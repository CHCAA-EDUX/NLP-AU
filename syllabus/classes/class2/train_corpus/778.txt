Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment? thanks Unless the tank has a built in overflow box (which I'm certain it doesn't) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump. The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box. On the other end of the sump, you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank. If you're going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank, getting a protein skimmer wouldn't be a bad idea. The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer, it's an in-tank design that could easily sit in your sump. NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet? From what I understand they're pretty much the same thing. Some of the major differences I see is the HD video, longer battery life, and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts.
