John Balance from Coil. (Don't wish to use Wikipedia again, it's just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balance http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html Balance died in 2004 after a 'fall.' He blended belief systems such as Shamanism, Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil's vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners. Not 200,000 guns - the numbers dont work: 5kg per gun, 200,000 guns means 1000 tonnes, impossible for 4 containers. If the load was 99 tonnes there were probably less than 20,000. E@tG:
