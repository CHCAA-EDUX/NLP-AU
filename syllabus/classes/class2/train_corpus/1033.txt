It was the best Chinese food I have ever had. All the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome. The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly. Every time I go, Kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and I. Overall, it is very family oriented, and I recommend it to everyone!!! Furnace repair Tiger Heating is awesome. I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced. These guys were absolutely professional. John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning.
