Well maybe a miracle could happen, but lets face it we're ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques! --- NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY From what we hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage. But that’s not the case. Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same-gender couples. One of “NCRC4ME’s” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “Declaration of Religious Leaders,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature. It presents the case for marriage equality and states, “We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.” A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session, so there is a real need for visible support for the “pro-same-gender-marriage” side of this issue. At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration.
