I love Cuban coffee, colada... mmmm anyways I found this place and can't stop going there, I stop in at least once a week and anytime I'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack. The place is chill and comfortable. They don't speak the best English but enough to get by. They bake bread fresh daily, they don't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it, and the meat is always fresh. They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat, chicken, steak, or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains. And their breakfast is awesome!! I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for. Stop in and have a bite you won't regret it. A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth! highly recommended.
