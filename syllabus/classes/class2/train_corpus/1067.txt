Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed. Equipment is state of the art. I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer. Dave is a patient and methodical teacher, who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take. Also, he loves teaching so much, his price is unbeatable, but that does not change his level of skill. Dave has much to offer. In just 2-3 focused lessons, I'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence! ~Jason We love our new roof! We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home.
