I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his/her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night. I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the 'nest cage' because he and the mother were fighting. He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there, were the baby was too. I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him.
