I've been to this shop twice (once for an inspection and again for an oil change) and they truly live up to their name: Discount! They have all kind of coupons available for car washes, oil changes, state inspection, etc. The thing is, you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates! There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you'd like. The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers. Top notch, all the way! David is amazing David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used. He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation. He was patient and adapted when everything didn't go according to schedule on my wedding day.
