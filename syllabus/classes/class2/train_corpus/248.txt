Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable. We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us. Thanks Joe Joe- a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line.. I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you probably already have this. We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting us over the limit, without me knowing... We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over Global's piece of the Cargill line...
