So I want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows. If they ask how much I'm willing to pay, what is a good price range? I saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile. Is that reasonable? Impossible to say, but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that, and some on top for the driver's time and effort, unless you are able to share transport with another or more, that would keep the costs down. Remember that you get what you pay for. Three hours isn't far, but you are doing multiple shows. Some people are willing to take your horse, but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world. Rusted, torn corners in the stalls, unhealthy air, straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard, if not downright dangerous, on your horse. I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big, open stock trailer.
