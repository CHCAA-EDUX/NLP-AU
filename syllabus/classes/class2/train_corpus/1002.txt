I Love Hellada Gallery! Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion (Not Digital) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him BAD COFFEE, DONT BOTHER! Can't you make a decent cup of coffee? You charge SO MUCH, yet you use the same grounds over and over again. The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter. No amount of sugar and milk can mask it. CHANGE THE PROCESS, PPL! Westfield and Rt 1 do it well, WHY CANT U???? Home made product
