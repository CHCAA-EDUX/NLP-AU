Can we get some help on the IBM issues? Erin Rice 11/10/2000 11:08 AM Steve: At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems. There are still four important issues, however: IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains. This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain. No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic instead. WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a separate company.
