I highly recommend her. Best Store In Boothbay Harbor What a fantastic store, I love this place. Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have. Their items are very unique, great quality, great prices. They also have the best tea I ever had, not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores, I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter. The BEST Dr. Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters. Dr. Aster is very kind an gentle with the children, but also positive and to the point with the parents. She is and excellent doctor to have on one's team.
