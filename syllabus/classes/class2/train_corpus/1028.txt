Already I'm considering future projects, and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing. I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad! They have messed up my order and.... The food was just not good! I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good... :( I hope they get there act together... I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see?? I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS. THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY. PLEASE DON'T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO: CRY, HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE. THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE, I GUARANTEE IT.
