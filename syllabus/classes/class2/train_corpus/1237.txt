Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room. So, therefore, now he says i am inoperable (even though i am not 100% inoperable), and he is letting me die. I am just middle aged and do not want to die, but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives. I, along with my friends, consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating. Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you". He said it sarcastically. If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor...he is the one for you. What you can learn from the below 'bad experience'. I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review. I'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they don't just take every dog coming in.
