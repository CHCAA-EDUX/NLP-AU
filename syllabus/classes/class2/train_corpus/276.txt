Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4, 360 Magnum Motor. Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual. Oh, it is dueled out through one catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound. Makes me want to race!!! I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well. Now, Debbie wants it. I gave $16,900 + tax. It is very clean and is Sandalwood, Driftwood or something of that nature in color. Almost silver. I have to pick up old gray over at Jerry's.
