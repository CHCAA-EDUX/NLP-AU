My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver (cooked) for the anemic one, some arthritis stuff for the oldest.

My favorite part is going up hill and cantering :) I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is, not how talented he is. If you took some Olympic-level horses on a trail ride, they just couldn't do it. They would be too scared and spooky.
