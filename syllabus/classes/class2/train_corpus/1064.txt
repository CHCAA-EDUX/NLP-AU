Stephanie's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range, made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did. We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley. We appreciated her patience, knowledge and kindness! Great Barber Firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick's, or he would know that Nick only charges $13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard. I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail. I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right. Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par, but if you wait for Nick... you'll be good. UGH!!! Got some nice "freshly baked" fruit squares, a personal favorite of mine.
