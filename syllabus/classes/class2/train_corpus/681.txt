The Beatles of the times of the "Cavern" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin. Without George Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as Oasis.... Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic, and he does lots of charity, thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife's life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic. He thinks he will deceive people in this way, so that the real McCartney will not be perceived. Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people. Satan deceiving mankind once again, as so many other thousands of times through the centuries.... After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "Devil's Island" through his nine main puppets (Beatles-Rolling Stones), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs, he made them proclaimers of homosexuality, aversion to religion, destruction of family values, dissipation, mental illness, antisocialism, etc., etc., The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve, was because the forces of Satan were behind everything, supporting the process. This mentally ill humanity, destroyed families, twisted moral values, manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings, anti natural feminism rebellion, drug addiction, corrupt social outlines, mad youths without direction, non respect to hierarchies, convulsed nations, misanthropy, misogyny, paedophilia, irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations, are due to the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, from the Devil's Island. If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, it is because you own some L.P, CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones.
