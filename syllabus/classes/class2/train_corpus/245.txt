I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman, Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk about a shotgun marriage! If we have time next week, I could step you through our website -- www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).
