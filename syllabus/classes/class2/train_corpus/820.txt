You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is, you can handle it. i'm5'3-4" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14.2hh and she's perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block.....only with a saddle though haha i can't bareback, not yet If you Don't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14'2 .. Anything smaller you will grow out, anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage, especially when riding. Hope I helped :) Where in the world is Iguazu? Iguazu Falls Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil, are a certainly must see attraction in the area. The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘Garganta Del Diablo’ (The Devil’s Throat), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air. With the sun shinning down on the spray, creating a rainbow in the foreground, this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph.
