Phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life. Bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data. Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier. The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to. The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid-May. Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming. In England, the cuckoo returns earlier. An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one-third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago. "One of the major, most well-documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities," concluded a report titled "Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States," released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week. Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.
