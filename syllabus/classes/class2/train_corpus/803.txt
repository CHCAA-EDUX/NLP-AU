Hi, I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage. (Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover) Which of these two cages is better: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893 http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/130589513308?var=430034792128&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648#ht_1500wt_660 I cant decide between height or width. http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_ This one is better for rats. You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats. They LOVE to climb. You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said, and make fleece covers for the stairs, so no ratty feet get caught and broken.
