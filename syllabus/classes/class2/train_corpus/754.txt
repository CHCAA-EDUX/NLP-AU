Would it be best for me to finish college? wait for 18th birthday? I live in London. I want to go travelling. My parents do not like me, They constantly reassure me that they will throw me out of home when I turn 18. I don't particularly want to stay with them atm either. But right now its the most convenient thing to do. Anyway Advice for travelling. What is the best way of doing it? Hotels for travelling will be expensive.
