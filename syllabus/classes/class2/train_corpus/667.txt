In 1594 PEREZ wrote & published a book under the assumed name of "RAPHAEL PEREGRINO." In the play Holofernes is ridiculing Don Adriana "the traveler from Spain" and says of him: "He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, Too odd, as it were, too PEREGRINate, as I may call it." -Act 5, Scene 1. To make the reference more pointed and unmistakable, Sir Nathaniel replies "a most singular & choice epithet," and at once enters it in his note book.
