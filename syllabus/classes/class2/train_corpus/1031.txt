We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs.. good also. I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great.. I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I went to get my nails filled Friday, by Monday 2 were broken. I was not happy with the way they looked, very wavy, uneven edges, and with the exception of 1, there is a dip in the center of each nail. I also had a pedicure, and they cut my nails too short, one of my big toes looks like its getting infected. No way. I'm certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong. Cold, slimy, tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods.
