Best answer shall receive points :) iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once, snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing, so why not give her a good hunt, but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something,, lol i dont know, i agree with you though throw him, haha Ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed, you can "gas it". Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it. If it won't take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface, like a refrigerator or wall. I don't like that option though - I think it's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake. I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane. You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive. And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey. Good luck!
