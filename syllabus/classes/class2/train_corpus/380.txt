This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately. Regards, Christopher Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on. Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system. We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system. We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost. In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs. Do we have someone who is watching this out there? We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.
