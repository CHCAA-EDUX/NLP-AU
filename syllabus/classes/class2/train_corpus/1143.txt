wonderful I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews. I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut. I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment. Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did. I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style. It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly. Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state. But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home. It wasn't completly impossible!!!!
