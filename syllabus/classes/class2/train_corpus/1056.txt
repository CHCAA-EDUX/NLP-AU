I highly recommend Fraiser's for anyone planning a special event for friends, family or business. FANTASTIC STORE!!! I came upon this store as the building caught my eye. It's located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building, by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway. The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories. The friendly crew working was great & very helpful. This store is what Colorado is all about. Also, I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great! It's durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon! Lovely People, Great Hats
