Either these people don't know anything about what they are renting, or worse- they are bait and switching. One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry. Outside of parking being at a premium, especially on discount days, The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I've been in. Yes, there are bigger, but bigger isn't necessarily better. I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service, taking just about a year's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded, clean clothes in clear plastic bags (I'd originally brought them in, in six large yellow garbage bags). The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future. Didn't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit. Whereas my answer to the question "Where do you get your laundry done?" used to be, "At the checkout line at WalMart," I can honestly say the answer now is, "At The Laundry Tub." Thank you! I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated.
