Mike Mark, I thought you would enjoy the comment about you. m Ken Rice@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/19/2001 07:24 AM Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today. I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning. I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch.
