Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect. That said - he seemed to be doing well enough. However, then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for. I expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared. Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out. Well, that was strike one. I wasn't going to use them again, but I was going to leave it at that. However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion. Last year, after all was said and done, I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no/little tax liability at the end of the year. He said yes.
