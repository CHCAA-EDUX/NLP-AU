However, New Orleans also had many affluent people, people who left town early as they had the means. I don't know if this will change other nation's perceptions of America. I suspect it will not change greatly... but you never know how much stock people put in the news. I do know that this will change the face of America. I expect that many of the displaced people (those affluent and those not) will remain in the places they were evacuated to. The 1.25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Galveston, and the surrounding areas. Sure, some will return, but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing, they may be shy about returning. I'm interested in what America will look like in 5 years. Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there? Or will the nearly year-round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives?
