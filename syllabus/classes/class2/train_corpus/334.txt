Thank you for your assistance. Marie Heard Senior Legal Specialist Tanya: I received this draft from Niagara Mohawk Marketing, Inc. for our review. Will you pass along to the appropriate person? Thanks! Marie Marie - per our conversation yesterday afternoon, attached are proposed drafts of the Schedule and the Para. 13 relative to the above. Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann, I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $8M each: one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f/b/o Enron, and one by Enron Inc. f/b/o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing.
