You are not French for a start, so the "rules" or "customs" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds. From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear. She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out . She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend. You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you. At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent. Take the messages for what they are: she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further. "Non!" means "non", not "I might consider it, and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case." Christiane gave you a good answer. You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding.
