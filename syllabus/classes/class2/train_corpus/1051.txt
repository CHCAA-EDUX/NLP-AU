Even though you are expensive. Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth. You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile. Con Garage I brought my car in for a simple emissions test. I guess they figured me for an easy mark, and tried to explain that my car wouldn't pass unless I replaced a hose. Ten minutes later, I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors. If you're a fan of herpes, being ripped off, and child molesters, this is the garage for you. If not, go somewhere else. Rude service
