You know, I've lived in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life. When not in Texas, I lived in LA and San Francisco. There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places... and I've vacationed through the south... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi, and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white (less than 20%) in northeastern Arkansas. The fact is, when I began traveling for business to New England, when I first visited my in-laws in Montana and Idaho, I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity. I didn't expect to react that way, but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua, New Hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, it was really very eerie. So, yes, America has pockets that are more diverse than others. Additionally, reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes, you'll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states. Unfortunately, those left behind to be filmed, where those without transportation or means. Some refused to leave, but so many were unable to. Yes, it's a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this.
