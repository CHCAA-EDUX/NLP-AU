Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable. In time though she/he will adjust. :) they just do it on their own. I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors? Last night, I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd. (He is 92 pounds) He does not listen to any commands, but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command, or even with me. I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away.
