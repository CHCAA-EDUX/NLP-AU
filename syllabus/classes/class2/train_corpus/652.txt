What I know is that I have a close friend who's aunt disappeared in New Orleans. My friend didn't have computer capability, so I spent the day searching and posting online. The family here (California) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA, so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there. The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names. The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available. It is Oct. 6, and not one family member has been located. What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation. What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans, saying that he didn't order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do. When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become? Recently, Bush addressed the nation.
