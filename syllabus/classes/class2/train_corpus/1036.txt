However, I still like this place a lot. Esp. the mole, tortilla soup, and guacamole. Margaritas are alright. My only complaint is the QUESO. It used to be fabulous, why did you guys change it?? Queso should not be watery :( ..... ***update*** NEVER MIND! They fixed the queso! Thankyouthankyou There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston....don't.waste your time here.
