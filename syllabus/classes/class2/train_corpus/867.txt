For obvious reasons, knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city, you should probably try to be near the subway system. But, can you immigrate? Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada. Start your process here, if you haven't already. (Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn't count for at least two years.) http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp A normal processing time, unless you have an advanced degree or a "specified" skill is from 3 - 5 years. Coming to stay, and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD. Lets be clear about this........... Just 'wanting to come to Canada " is NOT enough.
