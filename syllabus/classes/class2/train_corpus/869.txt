Toronto. How to train my puppy ? I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy. Recently I'm having trouble training him. He is kind of hate walking with leash, every time I put the leash on, he will try to bite it. And he is not following me when I was walking. I saw lots of videos about this, but actually it didn't help. Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ? And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them, doesn't listen to me. He is really excited about anybody he see.
