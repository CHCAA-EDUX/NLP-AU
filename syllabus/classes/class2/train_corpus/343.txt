Also, would those of you who have not responded to me via email confirming your acceptance of the terms upon which our four companies have agreed to assume cost responsibility for the TCA work on this. Attached is the letter I originally sent to you on May 10 in this regard. << File: Tabors Conflict Letter Alberta Export 050901.doc >> Regards, Rob Rob, This draft reflects the changes we discussed during our call the other day.
