Also NASA has a large outreach program for education, some people believe this is important. Best, Steve. Subject: Re: NASA IS A WASTE! From: jaqamofino-ga on 26 Apr 2005 06:02 PDT i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers' money, but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies, that i find it best not to think about it. i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste, but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA. of course, in a perfect world, tax payers' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program, and housing for the homeless, but this is far from a perfect world. in response to Steve's comment: do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone? and bridges??? i find that extremely hard to believe. i think it could have been done in a much more cost efficient way, right here on bad-old-planet-earth.
