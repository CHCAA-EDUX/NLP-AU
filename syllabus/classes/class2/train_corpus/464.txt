OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy." The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds." On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
