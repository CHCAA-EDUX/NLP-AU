Copies will be distributed. Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes! It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first. I didn't either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up. When you have a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel. I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London. I communicated that to Bob Bowen. He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business. Wow! Carol, will you handle this or Mark?
