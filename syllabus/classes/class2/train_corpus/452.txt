I've simply lost track! As for me, well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit), you know, the usual. Are you selling burgers up and down the east coast? Have you gone international? In a new franchise business? How's your family? Got to get back to work! This weekend I'm off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires on business. SARA SamChawk@aol.com on 09/11/99 07:48:44 PM
