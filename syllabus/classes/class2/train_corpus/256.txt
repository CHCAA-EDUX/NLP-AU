They will be there by noon on the 20th, and the surgery will last 1.5 hours and then they'll watch him for 2 more hours before they put him into ICU. They are hoping he'll only be in the hospital 48 hours. Scott Term sheet for draft contract, as requested. I have a change in plans next week. My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, so I will be heading that way on Monday. I was planning to be on vacation anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I would not have had otherwise. I will manage client expectations accordingly. Kay I hope you don't change your mind about going to the wedding Sunday.
