**Edit: Living on campus at Clarkson University, I have had food delivered before. This was back between '05 and '09 and I don't remember how many times we've had it delivered. Perhaps they don't deliver anymore, but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup. My 2004 x-type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade. I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF. Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out. I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael. He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive. I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade-in and the price of the 09 XF. The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.
