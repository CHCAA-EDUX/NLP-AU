Wow! If they are able to take earthworms uncut, that is really impressive! I aspire to your feeding regime, flakes early and something live later in the day. Worms (and Daphnia) are also rich in Lipids, substances important in forming eggs and growing young. I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males. If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below. If you have plants in your tank. your lineatus are already spawning. If conditions are favorable (78-82 F) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are, they will spawn. (I've even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer!
