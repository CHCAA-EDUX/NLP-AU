As I mentioned in my e-mail, John Lepore at Select Energy (Settlements Group) is trying to reconcile our list with his list. He needs more info about these trades (i.e., price info) and would like to talk with you about it. His number is 860-665-2368 and e-mail address is leporjj@selectenergy.com. Once we agree on the list, we can sign the EEI Master.
