Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST! My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re-wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved. I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable. He was prompt, knowledgable, friendly, clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business. I will reccommend his services however/whenever possible! Real pros I've had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers. I tell them: why not just go with these guys? Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish. They set out to exceed your expectations.
