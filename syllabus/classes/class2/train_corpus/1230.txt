He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic. It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don't have my table (which was NOT cheap, I might add). Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved. Poor Service Run don't walk. My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger. If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would. On August 21st, 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it. After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces. I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered.
