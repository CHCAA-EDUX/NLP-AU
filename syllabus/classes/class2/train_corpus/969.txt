But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way? would You like going for *coffee* with him? or is he Not your type? Or are you undecided? If i were you I would Go... I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get? I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming.. Edit... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing.. I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to... I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
