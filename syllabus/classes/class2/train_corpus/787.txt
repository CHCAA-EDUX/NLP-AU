She feeds well the baby on her own, the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night... What is the problem? Is this a transitional period for the baby...that he/she is left alone much more time? I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything...he/she sleeps. Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual. When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can't produce milk. It's fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm. If the baby is feathered yet - which I'm sure he is mostly - he should be fine. Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby. Ignore the answer above me, btw! ^_^
