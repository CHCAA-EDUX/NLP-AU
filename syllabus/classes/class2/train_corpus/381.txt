James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC. That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution. Thanks. DF James Centilli 12/14/2000 02:49 PM Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management. My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods. We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September. Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.
