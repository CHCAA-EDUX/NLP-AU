AMAZING! The portions were generous enough that we even took some home! I have to say the value of this place always amazes me. It's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service, amazing atmosphere, and Incredible food, but not break the bank while enjoying it! Bottom line is that when it's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service. Well Done! Great work and honest establishment! I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership, but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn't seem cost effective anymore. I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times. I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try.
