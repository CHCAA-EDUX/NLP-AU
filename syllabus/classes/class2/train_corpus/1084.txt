BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold. We both kept trying to find something we liked. The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges, I finally gave up, he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else. Liquidweb.com Rocks!!! I am not a client of liquidweb.com, but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites. I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb. As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not, and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting. The kind of support they provide is simply great!!! I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb.com
