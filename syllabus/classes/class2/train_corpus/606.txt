We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless, same-gender marriages. Likewise, a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at, and bless, same-gender marriages. The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law. As faith leaders, we commit ourselves to public action, visibility, education, and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry. -- Tom Dempsey Gulf Breeze, FL 850-748-0740 Email: Bill McGinnis <bmc...@patriot.net> The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President My Fellow Americans:
