I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago, and tonight, when my Mom emailed me about it, I re-read it, and went to the website with the song the author of the email created. Well, sure enough, when I heard the cats "Meowing," I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living, what went on in their tiny, sweet little minds, and decided that I want to do something about this torture. So, if anyone can give me some advice, I'd sure appreciate it! I think for starters, myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them. I will. I've pasted the email for those who haven't seen or would like to re-read it. It's also got the website where the song has been uploaded. I was thinking, that while I'm sitting here, relaxing and enjoying myself, those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust-esque death chambers. And what am I DOING about it? From: Travis Job <t...@sonic.net>
