Very affordable (don't call it cheap) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work. And the salsa, be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around, you will need them..... Dr. Mann killed our pet Yea, Dr. Mann ain't so great. We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead. We live in the sub-division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr. Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead. If you take him here for shots, no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again. Oh, they also charged me for the procedure ($250) AND had the audacity to charge me a $25 'DISPOSAL' fee. They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
