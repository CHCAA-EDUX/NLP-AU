I ordered 1000 postcards, we normally order 5000 or more. Because they had room to do 5000, they created the larger amount, and shipped them early. I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate! They have a customer for life in us! sheisters i made the mistake of buying from these thieves. I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor. Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck". Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right? Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home.
