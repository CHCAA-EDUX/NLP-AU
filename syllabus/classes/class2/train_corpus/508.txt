My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims. Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions. Great. Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure. You know when the meeting with schedulers will be? I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be. I'm thinking that I may want to attend. Thanks. Best, Jeff
