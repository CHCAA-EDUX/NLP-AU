Smart girl. I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren. Anyway, lots of fun meetings today. I'll talk to you later. Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier... I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully. At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things. However, having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors. Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the memory of an elephant). I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32.
