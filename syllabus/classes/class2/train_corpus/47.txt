But comfortable among the thugs, Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron, the US government. And though he'd been a faithful servant, he was not such a player that he could get away with that. He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark-skinned foreigners want extradited, CIA operative Michael Meiring. Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines, that "If this harms me in any way, you will find my power then, and you'll find out who I am." But then, maybe that wouldn't have saved him either, because Posada is not Meiring. Posada can be given up, but Meiring can't. Meiring's crimes are fresh, and wave the false flag which is the "War on Terror." They happened in the Philippines which, like Pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other. (Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines.) The bombings implicated Muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit.
