Hope you read through this. are the moors and penines in Yorkshire a lonely eerie place? and how big are they? im 33. ive never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all...i can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window. when i watched werewolf in london ( great film) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors. can anyone give me information about them? They can be bleak and eerie, often very exposed, often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds, stone circles and settlements--until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands,then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil. The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland. They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out, and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers.
