Don't have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks--there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl....... The Chernobyl Children's Project (http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp) offers several ways to help the children of that region. One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program, wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer. Even a little time spent receiving wholesome, uncontaminated food, good medical care, etc. can add years to their lives. S. and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years; to see these little ones breaks the heart. The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have. Take care, my friend, Linda I'm sorry to say Elena's story has been revealed to be a fake. What do the new al-Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization? Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2/3s of the top 25 al-Qaeda commanders, the middle managers are not in close contact with al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden.
