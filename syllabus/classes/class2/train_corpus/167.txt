At some point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position. I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy. To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls. I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options. Please look into that for me.
