Even partition is not a possibility, there are no clear borders between the two. Remember Luis Posada Carriles ? Here's a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo, published yesterday. ("At first I hid a lot. I thought the US government was looking for me. Now I hide a lot less.") Because of such talk, Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials. I can't imagine they wanted to do this. Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada's whereabouts with an indefinite shrug. As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country.
