What do you think of these photos? http://i.imgur.com/S2MD2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/T2zff.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Xytex.jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 (see links above). What do you think of these photos? The lighting was not the best, but the pics turned out ok in my opinion. deleting a question where you dont like the answer won't get you better answers... i refer to my previous answer: you need to learn about white balance, composition, angle, and work on using the camera properly... [edit - and she most be very new to modeling, because she does look unsure of her poses) lol, he has posted this so many times today already. clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it's NOT his gf Not bad, but too many distracting elements for my taste.
