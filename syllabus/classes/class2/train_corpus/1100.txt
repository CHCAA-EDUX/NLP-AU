Yes, you still have a few bugs, but that's going to be anywhere you go! The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord. She is a pure b****!!! I know that's ugly...but she won't help you out for anything...sad story. Other than that, I would recommend living here. :) The staff leaves a lot to be desired. The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude. A simple follow-up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare. She may be the reason for all the change. I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice.
