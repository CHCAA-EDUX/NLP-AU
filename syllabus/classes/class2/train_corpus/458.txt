* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers. * * Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges. * * Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007). * * Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects. The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. * * Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. * * Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. * * Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments. PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event. This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.
