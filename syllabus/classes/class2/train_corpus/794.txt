Or even N-DS or PSP. I'm a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X-BOX then a newer version comes out. ( Same for N-DS and PSP) Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year. Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works. No matter when you buy you will get a newer version. I feel X-BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years, its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK....coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort. XBOX Joys are soo comfyy..... Performance - You get the same in all, just get a good TV. I don't know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don't see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime.
