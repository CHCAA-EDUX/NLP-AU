Tues. Oct. 3 - Fly London to Houston (lv. around noon, arrv. around 4:30pm) To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors. I believe the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in London). Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there seems to be a problem with the attachment). If you still have it, can you send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"? I will take care of it. Thanks for the reminder. Ladies, Enclosed is a worksheet for Ineos Acrylics. Ineos is an English company which has a majority of its operations in the US.
