Treat yourself and go-- you will go back! I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town! The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices! Unlike Saratoga. I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself-- but the second time we went-- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were. Cannot wait to go gain. -R. Morris . I think that there pretty good. First of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one. They also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient.
