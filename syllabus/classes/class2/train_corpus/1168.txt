The craziest part is that they aren't even based locally at the city I'm in- they just have 'teams' in areas through the country. I've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them. Be warned- they'll ltake you for everything they can. Believe me. This is THE premier university in Virginia. It is also the largest. With a Pizza Hut, IHOP, 3 Starbucks, Chilis, Panera, and Chipotle on campus ALONE, VCU has some of the best eating options for students. VCU has the #1 art school in America, and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling. The Rams, the VCU sports team, also made the NCAA Final 4 this year, too! VCU also offers high-rise living for students and professors, and the historic yet fixed-up houses in the Fan are also available to students, professors, or even people wanting to live in a safe, viable community.
