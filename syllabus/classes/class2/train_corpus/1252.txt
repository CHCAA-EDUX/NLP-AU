I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible. Once I actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel. OK, one bad experience...fine. The following Friday, I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires, which were worn. I would not have gone back, but I couldn't find the particular tire they'd used in stock anywhere else. Once again, I waited for quite a bit before being attended to. I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected. He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week. However, when he printed out the service quote, I could see that it was NOT the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model. So I pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.
