They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins. The water changes help with that too. You also may need to treat the incubation water. The chlorine and ammonia (choramine) are not good for the eggs. Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs. THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe". Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult's desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone. If a pair isn't leaving eggs... check the following: 1. Is a tank mate (such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails) rating the eggs? 2. Have we kept up with partial water changes?
