Response: The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government. On the one hand, it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election, and to repeal the contentious "Legal Framework Order" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship. On the other, restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League-N and Pakistan People's Party, who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police. On the other hand, the US should strong-arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue. Al-Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow. The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than Iraq ever did. 2) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government. Response: The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas, and started the process of cutting off its funding. This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks. It should continue to be defanged.
