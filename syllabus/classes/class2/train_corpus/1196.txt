That being said, I don't know how their delivery service is. They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza, scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me. Good food, good wait staff, poor management We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia's on Greenfield Ave. The food was good, and so was our waitress. When it came time to pay the bill up front, they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip (which I have done with any other restaurant I've gotten a gift certificate for.) I then asked if I could have money back in cash. The person went to go check with the manager, who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there. Her answer was short and manner rather rude. Sorry for interrupting I guess.
