I'm getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it? I'm quite sure , you don't even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edges , the part that is making the noise . That might work Super Pet Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel Our Price: $10.99 to 12.99 PETSMART! works well lasts long. I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn't use it - he makes so much MORE noise, as he plays and digs and jumps (seriously) wheels are relatively noiseless - a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet!
