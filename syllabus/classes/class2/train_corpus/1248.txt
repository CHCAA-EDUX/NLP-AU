The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments. Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert. I guess that tells you a lot. Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good. The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination. And my--no, I still don't remember what I had. Service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable. Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience. But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts. PS) When we called for a reservation, we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings.
