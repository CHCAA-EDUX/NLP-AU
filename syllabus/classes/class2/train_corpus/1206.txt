THIS STORY IS 100% TRUE. That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss. Long Lines, Silly Rules, Rude Staff, Ok Food The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot. A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right? I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides. Well, this may be an exception. The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all. I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks. And don't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my French, a jerk.
