Half the tables and bar were empty by this point. Other Thoughts: Will try this place again. There must be a reason so many people like it there. Their Club sandwich looks tasty, maybe that'll change my mind.... and a different server. very professional / very helpful the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful. i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs. they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale. my experience with them was great - low stress, very helpful and very personal. after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible.
