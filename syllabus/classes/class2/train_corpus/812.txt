100 years ago? What are some fun things I could do while in Japan? I'll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do? I'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything. Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for. How is the night life in Naha? Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands, or just a venue at all? It doesn't have to be underground it could be any type of music. Thanks The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach.
