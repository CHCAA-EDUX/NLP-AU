On the Air France bus: As I recall, this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris. You'll still have to take another bus or the Metro down to Montparnasse. On the bus: Get on Bus 95 going toward "Porte de Vanves". Buy a ticket from the driver. Stay on the bus until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" stop. On the Metro: Get in the Metro at Opera. Take the 8 line toward "Balard" until the "Invalides" station. Change there to the 13 line toward "Chatillon Montrouge" and take it until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.
