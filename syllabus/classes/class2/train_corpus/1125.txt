We should have left then. We orderd our meals anyway, chimichangas,jalapeno borritos, and quesadillas. Everything was bland, completely void of any spice or flavor. We have never had mexican food this bad, it was just simply gross. Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long. I recommend La Hacienda Might try again Pros: * Jill, the owner, is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection, I like! Don't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides. Cons: * Server wasn't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time, took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating.
