The weekend was perfect in every way, in large part to Sue and her great staff. Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well. We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B...especially my 4 year old, who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies, and has talked about them since we left! We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe! Disatisfied customer, I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors. A&E came out, charged $129 fee just to walk in the door. I needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so I said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote. The second vendor charged $55 (less than half of what A&E charges) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service (which A&E does not). Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part. Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary!
