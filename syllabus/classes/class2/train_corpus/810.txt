After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking? If yes, was Canada involved in this act/law? Sorry, I'm just very nervous after watching the movie. SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea), which is an international maritime treaty, came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic. Today, it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships, regardless of country of registration. If you ever go on a cruise ship, you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill (lifeboat drill) within 24 hours of sailing.
