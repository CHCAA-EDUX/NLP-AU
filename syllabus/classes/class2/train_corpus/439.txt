Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work. In that respect, we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team. I think the first step is a call between yourself, me, Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero. And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite to lay out the plan. Barbara, please organize a call for Mike, Michelle, Mark Stubley and me. Thanks. David, I have been advised by our Construction Manager, Mr. Joe Osler that while he was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site. Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required. I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today.
