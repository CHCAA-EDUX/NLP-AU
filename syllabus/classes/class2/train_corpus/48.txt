Posada's crimes, on the other hand, must seem like ancient history, especially to a people who don't know their history. And to those who don't even know their crimes, not even that. But will Posada be given up? I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela, which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes. I expect it will be determined that, under "Strong Man" Hugo Chavez, Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial. The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi-like puppet in Caracas. Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference; justice would not be served then. But Posada's nearly 80 years old, and the Venezuelan people will ensure that's a vain hope. So instead Posada may be held indefinitely, in comfortable custody. An embarrassment to the US still, just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami, gloating in his freedom.
