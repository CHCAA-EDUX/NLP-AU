Do yourself a favor, call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again.. a great vacation! We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more! Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts. After a train ride over the mountains, we enjoyed hiking in the flower-filled Wenatchee hills (in May) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River...and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening.... This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant, which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need, and I'm sure they will do their best to be hospitable. OMG OMG.. make sure to book a reservation, as this magical place is packed (in a nice way) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food. The waiters are like no other... My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75% tip, and it was worht every penny..
