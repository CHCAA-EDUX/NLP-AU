Friendly staff, but definitely some problems May, 2009. We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out-of-town wedding guests. Got put into the wrong room the first night, and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am! Next day got moved into another room, on the same floor with other wedding guests. There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2, no linens for sofa bed. In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested. A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room. They were sent to our second room and had been opened--the ribbon-wrapped present, and all 3 envelopes. Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
