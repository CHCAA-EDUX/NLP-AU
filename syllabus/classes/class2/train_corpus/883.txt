My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities. The birth registration was done right in hospital. My last son, was born in Northern Ontario.... I didn't know that I didn't register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days. Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate, I find out he was never registered. I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay, have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me, as they don't have an online area for it yet, fill those out, send them away, then apply for his birth certificate. If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time, its simple to do it over the computer. For $56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back. This is in Ontario of course, the rates may be slightly different for other provinces/territories. You just need basic information, and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at/who was the doctor....
