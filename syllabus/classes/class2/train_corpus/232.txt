Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation. This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago. I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision. You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney. Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed. (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.) Thanks for all your help on this. David T.
