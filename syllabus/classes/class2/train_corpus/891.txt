What do you like to do? Big Cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia on the East Coast. Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta, Savannah, Charleston. The federal sites of Washington, DC. Southern charm of Nashville, Birmingham, New Orleans or Charlotte. West Coast hot spots like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego. Europe? Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US. Do you speak a foreign language? I could spend a year in Spain alone.
