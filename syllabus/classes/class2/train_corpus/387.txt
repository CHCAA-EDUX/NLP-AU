Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her offices - on 47 and 41. This particular chair is designed to help with back problems, which she has. Many people at Enron already have this type of chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular. The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax. Please approve the purchase of two. Thanks! sorry, i left lou off of the message. Drew Fossum 01/13/2001 09:45 AM Lou, do we have any sort of policy on requests like this?
