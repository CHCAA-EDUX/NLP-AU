Otherwise, you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan, like shopping, eating, etc. Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa. Well first you can try speaking Japanese. Go to a sumo tournament. Eat at a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant. Climb Mount Fuji. Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan, although of course there are similarities. The main thing people do there is go to the beach. There's the market in Naha, which is great. You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious, fresh sashimi/sushi lunch upstairs.
