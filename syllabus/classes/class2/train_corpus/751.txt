Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect. No one's going to take you seriously if they're full of typos and whatnot. Sorry, I would put that application in the round file. Nope Canadian student visa, can I used for other schools? I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada, I received one that is valid until October of 2015. Problem is, for some reason, the visa process took longer than it should, thus I missed school this semester (visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn't attend), now I no longer want to go into that school (because they only would accept me again on September of 2012), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012, can I use the same visa that was issued to me? or do I need to reapply ? (in the visa itself, it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend, and problem is, the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions....) any advice please? Visas and Study Permits are administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them.
