Meats are kept VERY cold, seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean. Prices are reasonable, (Kids meals are around 4.99) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices, I believe. Great Cookies, Cakes, and Customer Service It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store, but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake, Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake. Not only did it taste wonderful, but the texture was unbelievable, the frosting wasn't overly sweet to over power the cake, and the cake itself was just amazingly soft, and fluffy, and just perfect overall. Although I'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there, I'll gladly do it knowing that since she's been astounding to me once before that she'll always be that way! (Also she has a really great website! And we bought a few cookies there too, they were fantastic as well!) She deserves many 5 star reviews!! Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
