“There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official. Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim. ‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National Security Directorate. ] Karzai, Musharraf new regional equations KABUL: For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers -Russia and India. The neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan’s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it. “The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan, a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all. Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan’s English daily The Nation. All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process, but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan.
