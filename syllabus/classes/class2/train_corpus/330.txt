We've been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "Babies Elliott" had arrived. Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size, and that Mom is doing well. Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones. I know you all are going to have so much fun with them. Hope you've been storing up sleep, cause it looks like you won't be getting much for a while. Again, congratulations. These three little ones don't realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad, but I'm sure they'll find out soon. Take care Marie Ladies and gentlemen,
