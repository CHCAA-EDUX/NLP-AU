Look in the pet stores for "fry food" or "baby fish foods". what kind of newborn fish you have? some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes I have a question about McDonald's Monopoly!
