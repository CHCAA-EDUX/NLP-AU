You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about. They have seen your pet, and are most aware of his condition. No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can. You need to ask your vet these questions. Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast. Bland food. NO SPICES! My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, it could be a sign of obstruction. Did they do any x-rays? I don't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment.
