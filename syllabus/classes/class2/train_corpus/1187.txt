When they sound off, it is a true audio/visual experience. I called the front desk and got no answer. After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none, I decided to just pack up and leave. The desk agent actually argued with me, claiming that no such alarm had gone off (as if I would make that up?). He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded, so only 4 guests were effected (no big deal to him). This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times. This hotel is adequate enough, but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management. Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night.
