This parody on PEREZ' sobriquet clearly identifies PEREZ with Armatho.>> ---------------------------------------------------------------- Shakespeare Electronic Conference, Vol. 6, No. 0832. Monday, 23 October 1995. From: Martin Green <MGr...@usa.pipeline.com> Date: Sunday, 22 Oct 1995 10:57:32 -0400 Subject: Re: Facts, Purpose of List, Italy, Jews <<There were no Jews in England to speak of in the 1590's. True, but two in England that we know of were a part of the Essex entourage: Dr. Lopez, who had been physician to Essex' step-father, the Earl of Leicester, had apparently treated the young Essex for some socially unacceptable ailment, and Antonio Perez, who was a guest at Essex House in the early 1590's. To be sure, both Lopez & Perez were conversos--but they were thought of in England as being, as they undoubtedly were, at least ethnically, Jews.>> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
