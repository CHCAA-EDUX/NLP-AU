ya i really wouldn't bother with the yoga maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and i've thought about getting one. with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps (on the ball of your foot) and balance to strengthen those muscles You don't want to spend more than $20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses? I really can't help you. What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis? My dog has been sick for about 3 days now. He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight. I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water. I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal.
