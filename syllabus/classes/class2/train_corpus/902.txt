And no, I do not work for them. :) I am just a satisfied customer. And don't expect to party on this tour. The south is not like the regular tourist towns. Very few clubs and night activities. Oh, if you are confused. Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe. It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc. tele#84838389593 have fun.
