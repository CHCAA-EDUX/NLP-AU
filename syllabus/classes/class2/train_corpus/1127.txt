from start to finish they were top notch. i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car. This insurance co. Is a joke !!! They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever . if you don't mind being robbed ,cheated or lied to then this is the company for you . They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves . They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation . as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ? I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ? Ifa is an acronym for Im a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
