Is it true? I have told a French girl I liked her, and she accepted. She is friendly when we see each other on campus. She is also nicer when we are both alone. However, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me. She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop! My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along. But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary. Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap? What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios.
