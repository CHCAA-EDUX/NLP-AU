We have two. They are social and like to be handled. You have to have two because they don't do well alone. Make certain you get two females. Two males can fight and you definitely don't want babies!! Guinea pigs (also called cavies) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night. They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce. They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos, celery, cucumbers, carrots. Don't feed them broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, onions, head lettuce ....they are all too difficult for them to digest. Also they can't eat potatos, they are toxic for them.
