On Monday, Louis Lamonica, 45, the former pastor of Hosanna Church, was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago. We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose. If I was Rummy I'd send Posada to Iraq to blow things up there. yeah, "things"... Yesterday evening, the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany (ARD, Tagesthemen). The newly released papers, showing him complicit in the airliner bombing, were mentioned gandalf Now that's a post I can relate to. You really got me thinking, I enjoy reading this blog. I don't know how others feel, but I'm definitely looking into immigration to Canada as an option.
