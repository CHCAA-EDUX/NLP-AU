My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year. There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report. Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New. So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against. Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report? Sorry that this response looks so long. I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense. Thanks for sharing this with me. Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some. --Sally
