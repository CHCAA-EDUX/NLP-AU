Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems (as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses). But supporters are pointing a few good things out: Clearly, the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent-minded investigative panel. A few weeks ago, shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket-like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry. One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal-protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed. The other is a new fuel tank "guaranteed" by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation. NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future. But lets hope for their sake (and the sake of all space lovers out there) that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again. Selah. --
