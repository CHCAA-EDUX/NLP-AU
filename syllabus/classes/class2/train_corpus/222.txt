Can you give me the Sitara deal #? Thanks Darla should be non bondad Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy. Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP. Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?
