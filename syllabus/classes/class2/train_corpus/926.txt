It's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month. are my two cats fighting or playing? how rough is too rough? help!? i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten. the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that. the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out, and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing(chasing each other up and down the hall, rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other). only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine. were they roughhouse playing? or were they actually fighting?
