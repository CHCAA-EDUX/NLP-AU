Are you saying I'm bad in bed? How would you know? Joking. Your answer is very sweet, but I'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students. A little mellow dramatic? In my opinion, far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees. Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting, but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications? I'm studying to be a teacher, so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I'm done. I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland, but at least I can be pretty sure I'll be employable. I've also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession.
