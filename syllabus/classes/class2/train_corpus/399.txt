Many details remain to be worked out, but we will keep you advised. In the meantime, could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues? What do I need to do? Jim Vince J Kaminski@ECT 04/30/2001 02:28 PM I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job. I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston. The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.
