How to prevent this ? Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him, he will try to jump on, if he can't, he will bark all the time until I let him get on, what should I do with this ? Anyone have any suggestion? thank you very much. Hi, I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs. You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness. This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades. This way, he cannot reach the leash to chew it. When he swivels his head to go for it anyway, tell him sharp "UH UH" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk. Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash.
