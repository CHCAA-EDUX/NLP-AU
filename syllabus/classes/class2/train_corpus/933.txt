TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT…. Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists. They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit. The people rejected their attempt to topple the government, and for all intents and purposes the US military (and the ARVN) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time-frame he ordered it. All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces. But Johnson was so obtuse he didn’t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter. Instead he pulled the military off, stopped the bombing of North Vietnam, withdrew from the presidential race, and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam. They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it. The American people were NOT having any of it, and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made (not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding). In the end Nixon kept his promise for “…peace with honor….”
