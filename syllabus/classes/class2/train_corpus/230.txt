If no one objects, I will be the lead coordinator on Florida starting tomorrow. OK, I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE. And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!!! Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself? Our last call was Iris Kind, Bill Savier(sp?), and Jeff Davis. Don't forget about me.
