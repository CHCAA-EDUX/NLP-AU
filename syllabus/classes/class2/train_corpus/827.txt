This is like trying to Make 2 people get married. It doesn't work. First you need a compatible pair. Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other, so there is hope there. Then the need to be mature, that is, old enough, and big enough to breed. This may be around 1/2 of their full adult size, probably 4-5" for those guys. Then the environment. Large tank, no annoying tankmates, perfect water conditons and really good feeding. The difference is what they need to live, VS what's ideal for them. Get that right, and they will mate when THEY are ready.
