If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know. Take care and hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Ben Rogers Professor Ronn: I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program. In the end, the results were not favorable. I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability. After talking with you and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance. I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year.
