They don't care one bit about you!!!!! Terrible service!!! Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate. They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate. When I called the manager to complain, she said she KNEW the guy didn't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier! Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead. So what was the point of the appointment!?! To just come over and hang out?!? I will NEVER do business with this company! EVER!!!
