I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people. And they THRIVE to get a customer. DO NOT go here..thank you Horrible I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off. I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top, 2 inch long hair on the sides, and 1.5 in the back. My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous. This woman should be working in supercuts...if that. This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that. Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment.
