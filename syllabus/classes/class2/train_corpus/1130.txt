I'm glad I trusted my gut and didn't get sucked into doing business with them. Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right. Don't waste your time or money! I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced. Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish. If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this. If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of Â£30 for 2 two people then go for it. (For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!) Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough. I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson.
