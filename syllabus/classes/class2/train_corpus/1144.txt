I am definitely going back After recently relocating to South Bend, we were looking for a delicious, fun, yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner. We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal, and accessibility to the Jazz Club. The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor, especially for being a special NYE menu. The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced. After our meal, our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $10/person to stay and listen to the band, despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list. This was a less than impressive experience at Trio's. Run for the hills ... you'll be much better off! One night was too much. First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified.
