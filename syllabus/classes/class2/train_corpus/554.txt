"My first thought was to push it away," he said. "A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear's paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling." The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears. The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack, experts said. The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31-year-old Alain Parenteau. "Their screams changed," Dr. Fortier said. "I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out." The bear dwarfed the 6-foot-1 Mr. Parenteau, knocking him to the ground, he said. Dr. Fortier threw a large rock at the bear, distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25-year-old Patricia Doyon, who was in the same tent. Again Dr. Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape.
