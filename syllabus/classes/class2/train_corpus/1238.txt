I've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs. It's unfortunate that bmil believed that his 'perfect' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself. But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs. Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively; and it's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem. It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems. You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him. But not at a risk to other people's pets. You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later. No business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing? My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
