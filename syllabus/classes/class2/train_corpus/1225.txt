Just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon. I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don't show up, they'll charge you. I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick. After he already put product on my hair he said "I should warn you, I'm expensive." What was I supposed to do, say I can't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair. I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown. The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's so wonderful, you're going to love your hair. $400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total. Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price. I cried the entire way home.
