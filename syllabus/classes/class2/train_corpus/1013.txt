You NEVER get a human on the phone. It's impossible to get an appointment. If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule... for 6 weeks later. And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient. Go somewhere else. Rcommended by bees, too! Highly recommended. Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt, friendly and informative service. No spraying of pesticides! Very professional.
