As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice. It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us. But, I guess, it's a start... I've already made my XMAS plans. I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.
