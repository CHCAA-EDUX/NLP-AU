Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable! I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists, physios, osteos and chiros with no help. It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal! And now 2 months after my last appointment I am better than ever. Thanks guys! They must have read these reviews and improved! My husband and I happened in on a whim. We sat in the front dining area, it was very cozy and pleasant. Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic. My husband has been a professional chef, so he is a good judge of quality food.
