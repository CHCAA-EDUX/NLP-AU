If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry. If he doesn't seem interested in them at all I would say he's just not hungry. My boyfriend has one and when she's hungry she attacks the pinkie right away. They can smell it so i'm sure he knows what it is and just don't want it. Remember snakes can go awhile without eating. In the winter, they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation-like state called brumation, which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity. King snakes sometimes stop eating, particularly during the cooler part of the year. They have a natural instinct to hibernate. If the snake is not pregnant or shedding, and its enclosure is properly equipped, a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation. Hibernation is natural, and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred.
