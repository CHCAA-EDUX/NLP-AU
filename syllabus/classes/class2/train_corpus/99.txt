"No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked. They're inseparable," he says. Yeah, I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months: "To hell with death". I wholly agree, and would expand that statement to include: "To hell with death metal". The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ? Talk about a beat-your-head-against-the-wall moment! And for 'Smartwolf' above, think about the inversion principle being employed. They are doing it deliberately. Do you really think GWB, and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth? (I know, ignorant question) Then why call them, or any other phonies 'Christians', even if they themselves claim the appellation.
