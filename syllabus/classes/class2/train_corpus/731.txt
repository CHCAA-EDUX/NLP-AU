I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house, and since I was able to catch it very easily (normally mice move at the speed of light), and since it was acting unresponsive, I thought it was infected with mouse poison, since my friend uses it. I know that the mouse will probably die, but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison? I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( . Without knowing the exact poison, no. A common one is arsenic and there really isn't a way to cure that. Take the mouse to an emergency vet and have them use CO2 to put the mouse to sleep. Or, you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals. A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it's head. Crayola Air- Dry Clay? Ok.
