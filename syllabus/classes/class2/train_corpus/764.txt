Go to Jeju island! It's so much fun over there, and I'm positive that you'll love it! :) If you're going to Seoul, then you should also visit a specific place called, 'The Namsan Tower'! It's a really huge place over there, and so many visitors/foreigners went to put chains and locks over there! It's so much fun! Also, don't forget to try out Korea's famous amusement parks!: Lotte World, Everland, and Carribbean Bay! Everyone loves it! ^_^ Lotte World: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X_e2uwT6wPw/Tkj_7UVTw6I/AAAAAAAAAGs/e_hICAdYPYI/s1600/lotte_world_from_high_up.jpg ( It's indoors and outdoors!)
