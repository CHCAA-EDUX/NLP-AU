The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead. The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life. I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him. NO, I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam. We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs. He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss, and some muscle atrophy. He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws. So I might get the horse and see what I can do. I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him, have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test. Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well.
