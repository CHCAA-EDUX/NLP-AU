look up fumarase deficiency for more info. Also look up the kingston family. One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from 'marriage' to her father's own brother. no one was charged for forced marriage, only the beating. So we "lost" some weapon? It's a good thing too. We wouldn't want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us. Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate. What's a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash? They really are milking the incompetence angle though, aren't they?
