As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives. But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes. Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU. He is joining an excellent company. I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA. As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can. As to our family, within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina. They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires. They're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami, Florida. This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.
