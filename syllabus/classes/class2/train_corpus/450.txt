Hope you'll have time to review it today. S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording (drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c. Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week. With best regards, Per
