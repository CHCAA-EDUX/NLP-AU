I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet). If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me. Thanks, Kay Forget the ONE or more contract questions. I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project. I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI: We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment. Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic? Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?
