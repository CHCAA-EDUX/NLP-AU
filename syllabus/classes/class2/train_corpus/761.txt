We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close. I have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu... I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments. I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome. It's narrowed down to Butcher and Singer, Davio's, and Del Friscos. Thanks in advance for the advice. Sidenote... I am familiar with the Capital Grille, Barclay Prime, The Palm, The Prime Rib, Mortons, Ruth Chris', etc. I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste. Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier. Many thanks.
