Yikes! That girl's mother sounds like a real problem. I'm not sure how I would have handled it. How's school going? Any plans for the weekend? Alma Martinez@ENRON 01/26/2001 11:36 AM What happened? Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus. The mother was running late for work and could not wait.
