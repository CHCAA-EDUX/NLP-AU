Terrible Service One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a auto repair shop. We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning. Approx 4 months later, the compressor went out. We took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out. We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work. So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks, we brought the car back again. When we expressed our discontent to the manager (that's right, the manager), did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say "I'm sorry". Nope, none of the above. He stood there and told us how he wasn't at fault.
