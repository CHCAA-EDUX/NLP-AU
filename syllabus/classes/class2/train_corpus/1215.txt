Three weeks ago, burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home. The intruders slit the screen of the window. Next, they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer. The window didn't break! My next-door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light, thankfully scaring the two miscreants away (they even left their hammer behind!). I called Home-Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they weren't even going to charge me for the replacement screen...that it would be covered under their guarentee. Lo and behold, they replaced the screen (which had to be ordered) yesterday and didn't charge me a dime. Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me. In this day and age, it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies. I rarely write reviews such as this one, but they certainly deserve anyone's business!
