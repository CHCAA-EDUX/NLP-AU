Thanks Run on! Great This is a perfect place to get your hair done. I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut. When I get my hair done there, they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair. The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy, but the wait is worthwhile. Highly Recommend I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed. No matter what state I am in when I arrive, I always leave feeling better. She has not only helped me through some challenging computer-work and sports related injuries, she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond.
