Theyre not really hard. Beardies are actually quite delicate. I'm assuming it's to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies. they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them. They just are there as an adaptation. what is a kimberwick bit used for? Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking, hunting and doing cross country. It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues. It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins. The lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too.
