Kline Motherwell By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago. It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling). It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000. Is there 1 available? Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one. Thanks, mike Huskers drool over Sooners.
