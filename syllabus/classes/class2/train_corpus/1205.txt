I chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get. I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call. I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel, but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers. Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker. He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying, "you do not order what you do not know about" and "you don't know how pizza is made". It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old. He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home, the pie was the worst I have ever seen. Cheese was falling off, so oily and greasy. I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt). I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $25.
