I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test. Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business. Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me. It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future. Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know. Take care and hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Ben Rogers Professor Titman:
