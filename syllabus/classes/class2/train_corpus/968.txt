He is a few years older than me. And yes, I do like him. To answer Barry White, yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he's waiting for. On the other hand, he could very easily just call me and say hey I'm busy right now, I'll call you when I can come out. And as far as scheduled visits go, I have no idea. I've never done that before though either. It's always just "Okay, they're feet need to be done, better call the farrier." And they usually come out within a few days. He will call you back Im sure! Sounds like He really likes you..
