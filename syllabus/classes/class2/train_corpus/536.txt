These are the kids who will destroy society, because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture, you heard again. And you might think by reading this I blame the kids..... Not so, Kids are what kids are and will do what they do. It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them. That will likely never change. It's the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids, it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids. Very few parents do this. And this is a direct result of the Politically correct, permissive, time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this. When you blame it all on society, there's noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking, drinking, doing drugs, fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they're doing. People like this will never have my sympathy, nor do they deserve my sympathy.
