Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful. It's pretty combative actually. you'll love it I have had my back fused in 2 places. I wish that I hadn't done this. With these fusions, chiropractric isn't as successful, but it still is very helpful. Even after my fusions, my back continued to hurt, but now it doesn't hurt any more. I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery, to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros. He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly. You can see different treatments that a surgeon can't see, so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do.
