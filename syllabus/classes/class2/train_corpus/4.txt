In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas, mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya. Baghdadis don't venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more, you never know where you might get stuck. There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again. My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now, helicopters have been circling over our heads non-stop. Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever. Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area, then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK-47's in the air. They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people. And there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land. Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so don't expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn't bomb them, and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen? Everyone is apprehensive, there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days.
