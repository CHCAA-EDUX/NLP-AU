They have a huge inventory. I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great. I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital. Yes, we had to wait, but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first. Any ER would be the same. As far as being treated like a drug seeker, that has not been my experience. As a nurse I know about drug seekers. This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system. Wonderful Experience I had immense pain on a Sunday morning, with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday.
