No pancreatitis or anything abnormal. The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics. So my question is.. Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis? and will these antibiotics help? I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it.. what should i do? i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food? ... Some help would be great. thank you :) They didnt take x-rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment.
