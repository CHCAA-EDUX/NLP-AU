An Afghan official at the meeting added, ‘’The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda.’’ Karzai was clearly pleased at the results. ‘’President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban,’’ says Karzai. The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq, a clear snub to the Americans. Until then he had said Pakistan’s options were open. However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting. US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush’s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections. However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side. ‘’Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before,’’ says Lt. General David Barno. ‘’There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border, but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways,’’ he adds.
