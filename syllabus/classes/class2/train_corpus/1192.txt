After a good few minutes, he asked: "what do you want?" Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked. I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms. He immediately said "no, there is a $50 deposit now!" Sure enough he charged it to the credit card. When I inquired he rudely replied "in the morning when things are checked out you'll get it back." I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check-in. I also mentioned to the reception person. He responded "we have problem with 'people'". Imagine a hotel having problems with people.
