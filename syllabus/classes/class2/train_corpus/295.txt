If Jeff is happy, I'm happy. Kay Hello - I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights. His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L.L.C. However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron's interests. 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement. This language has been included in the attached draft. My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end of today. Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day.
