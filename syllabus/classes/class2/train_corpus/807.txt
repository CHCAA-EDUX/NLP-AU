My bday is Saturday :) and I wanna have breakfast/lunch with my fam. I was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having Having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places I know are denny's and ihop. Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^_^ I would strongly suggest "The Breakfast Club" in Chicago. You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices. Don't be in a hurry though. Just relax and enjoy. They have fabulous French toast too. The Breakfast Club & Grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the Kennedy Expressway. There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot.
