BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! McDonalds Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go. A lunch will be less expensive than a dinner. You can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner. But the best way is to use coupons. Check out http://www.restaurant.com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices. Yo also may want to try "small neighborhood" restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains. Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area. Is there any cure for mouse poison?
