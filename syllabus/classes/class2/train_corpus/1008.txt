First Time Ballerina My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time. I'ma soccer mom so I wasn't sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear. The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina. The service at Instep was great!! I would recommend them to anyone! Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price! This place is top notch and highly affordable! I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer. I've also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased!
