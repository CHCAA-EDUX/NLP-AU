http://www.mikegigi.com/techspec.htm#SELCTEMP You might be able to make a version of your setup work, but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air. I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food? Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer. They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods. Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food. Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen, for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham. Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork, alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat, but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods. Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions.
