I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents. When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital. As long as that was done you can send for it at any time. Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it. Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise? ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD *BOTH* !! i want to know which you liked better and WHY? include which one had: -better food -more fun activities
