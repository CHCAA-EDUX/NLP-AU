11/08/2000 02:19 PM Dear Mr. Sanders - ? While I left a you a phone message with some information about our project, I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as well... ? We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler, and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however, is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the Protocol. I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for eCommerce B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small working groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service offerings.
