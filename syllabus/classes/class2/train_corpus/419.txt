04/16/2001 05:51 PM We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include, "a division of Cargill Incorporated". We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty. Bill Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed. The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names. If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself. That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
