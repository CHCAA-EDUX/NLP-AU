Thanks. Angie Buis EBS-Tax x-37097 Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring/Natural Gas Strategy proceeding, including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement, the Comprehensive Settlement document itself, and the various appendices to the settlement.? Because a number of the declarations and signature pages are not yet available electronically, they have not been included with this note.? Hard copies of the Comprehensive Settlement, including all declarations and signature pages, are being shipped tonight via US mail to all parties on the service list.? Additional printed copies should be available within the next day or so and I will make them available to all of you - just let me know how many copies you need. I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement process.? You have all devoted considerable time, resources and spirit in the preparation of this document - and it shows.? We now have a settlement before the Commission that includes ratepayer advocates, commercial and industrial customers, electric generators, marketers, shippers, independent storage providers,? gas suppliers,? producers, utilities, aggregators, pipeline companies, wholesale customers, municipalities, and retail mass marketers, among others.? While we should be proud of our accomplishment, we now must turn to the task of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline.?
