Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead. I guess you get what you pay for. I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend, so we asked for a single queen bed. We got there, and we were treated to the free "upgrade" of a room with two double beds. Since they consider this an upgrade, they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room. Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door....right next to the ice machine. We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room. When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had "reserved" I was thoroughly impressed! I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
