I lived in one that did not face the parking lot. Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper. It sucked having an SUV. If I found a spot, I couldnt fit in it. Gates worked 30% of the time at best. Bugs were a small problem, nothing too bad. The best there is in service. I was recently traveling down I-24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro. It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud, he would take care of me. Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday, they hit the ground moving!.
