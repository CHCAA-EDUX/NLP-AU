He did not give them the number of troops they requested. This left Westmoreland with few options, so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is, in the long run, the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency. Thing is, it worked. The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC (the guerilla movement), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC (which was light infantry) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower, and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia. All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct, the Communists WERE being defeated. However, Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases. He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack, but he ignored his military advisers. The Communists agreed. They could not defeat the Americans.
