Fantastic for kids If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you'll love this zoo. It's only $10 and in essence just one big petting zoo. They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots. We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when (very harshly I might add) grabbing and 'kissed' the goats and lambs. The animals were all very sweet and patient with her. Among the animals that were available to touch were pony's, camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH!!! Wonderful, inexpensive and lots of fun! WOW!!! I can't say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee.
