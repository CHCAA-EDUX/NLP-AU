I beg to differ. This place is marginal at best. Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained. I was not impressed, and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses. I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course, because yes, it is not the same, but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve. I don't want to waste my time on routes set for children, but I don't want to take on something I can't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion. Rate the routes, with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy, moderate, and hard. Again, a great outing for the kids, a frustration for an out of town climber.
