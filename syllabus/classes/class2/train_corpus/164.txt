Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work. I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad. If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K). Please advise. Thanks, Anne Clayton, Thanks a lot. I appreciate all your help.
