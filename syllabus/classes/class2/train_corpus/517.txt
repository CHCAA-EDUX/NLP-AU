My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state. Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward? Thanks. Sounds good. I suggest a "blind draw" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf, and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week! Is there any question? I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal. As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit. Best, Jeff
