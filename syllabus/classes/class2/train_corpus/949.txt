The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up. Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella.. As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes" Afraid I cannot be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa. If you mean the Republic of Ireland (Dublin) then anytime. The summer there is much more mild than most of the US (are you coming from the US?). Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall. It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet. September for example. Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime.
