what are some unique customs in ireland? As far ask I’m aware our most unique custom would be the “Country Wake”. In all my travels I’ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners. After a person dies, their remains are “waked ” in their home for roughly 2-3days. In this time visitors will come to the house, pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun. The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains. Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike. But only really in the countryside. The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral, this tradition started after the civil war. Another unique custom (and a dying one at that) is the Pioneers.
