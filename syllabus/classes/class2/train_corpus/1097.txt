4) The business is very unorganized. The invoice is not detailed, so it is difficult to see what you are paying for. I'd recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store. Exile is the best!!! Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond! I have been shopping there for over six years now. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner, Mimmy, is an absolute angel. The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe. In addition, the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic, which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia. Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community.
