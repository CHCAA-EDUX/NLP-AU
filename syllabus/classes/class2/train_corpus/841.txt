Silkies have hookless feathers. Sussexs have soft feathers. All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers, as hookless feathers are a recessive gene. Skin Color: Silkies have black skin color, which is dominate. Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate. Either way rec. and dom. white genes dilute the black gene. Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies. Beards/Muffs: If your Silkie has a beard/muff the offspring could have a beard as well, as these genes are incomplete dominate. Feathered Feet/Shanks- Chicks could have feathered feet/shanks as this is also incomplete dominate. Crest: Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene.
