i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes. they will move if they get too warm-it's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs. i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine. i have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system. on the side is a waste-leave it on the bottom. good luck! Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper... I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner What are good places to eat brunch at? ?
