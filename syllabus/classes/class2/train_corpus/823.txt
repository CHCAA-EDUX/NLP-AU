I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal (apparently this is "washing down" your food") and not ordering wine. You'll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris. However, outside Paris everybody is wonderful. Nobody likes the Parisians, even then Parisians don't like Parisians. South France is wonderful, right on the Mediterranean. It's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly. I used to live in London for 6 months and it's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world (I've been to 45 countries in 5 years). Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly. However, if you're allowed another option and you want a small-town feel, then head to Edinburgh, Scotland. I lived there for 8 months.
