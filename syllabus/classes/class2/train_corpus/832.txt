You should check for updated information on a regular basis." The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency. And between the time I began my research and the time I applied, the minimum score did change once. Unfortunately, both minimums were above my score. But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident. So keep checking at least on a weekly basis. GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq-skilled-workers.html . Here is what they posted there "4. May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points?" "If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada, the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion (referred to as substituted evaluation) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points."
