He told me "no problem, we will match the offer or do better." Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems. Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world. I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!! Excellent customer service!!! Great, Honest Service I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold. The dealer wanted $1300 to fix that and another $1500 to fix some other things. Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $400!! I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission!
