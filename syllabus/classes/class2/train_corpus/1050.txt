Food good, service poor No silverware, asked for a spoon for my sons mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon. Asked for bar-b-que sauce never got it. Never checked back with us once we got our food. Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins. Only one server, too buys talking with others I guess. Food was good, but service means a lot to me. Dr. Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had. You are knowledgeable, professional, gentel and kind. I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now, However I am glad you are my dentist now.
