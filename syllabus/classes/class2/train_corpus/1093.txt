I came in and saw Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking. I have to tell you that I haven't had one and don't want one. It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too. I sent a customer of mine to you. Dr. Ruona, if you read this, thank you for helping me get more healthy. I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before. I can't thank you enough.
