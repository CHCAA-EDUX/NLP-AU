Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried. Crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red-lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded. Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety's sake. I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly: http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1 mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in..atleast as far as i'm concerned. if there are shady areas he can move to (for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side) then you can leave it on a full 12-14 hours, if its a small tank and he can't escape the light then 4-6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4-6 hours at a time twice a day. either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven. as to what the light provides it gives UV rays..which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
