10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line. I will also add granting/perfection language. 11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm not sure exists. In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation. 12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1. 13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c). I would add setoff language.
