It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car. And what did we expect...that he bench test every part. At no time during the conversation did the words, "I'm sorry" ever come out of his mouth. I, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again. Well, unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out. Do not use this company! I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced. I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off. They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace. I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00.
