I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year. I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico. Hey guys, Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000 - Dec 2000? Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months? Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month. I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced. Thanks Darla I can't get through on the phones.
