Seriously: do not waste your time. Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners. Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service. I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life. AWFUL SERVICE! After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past, I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location. I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire. I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use). Once inside, I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before--FINALLY-- a technician got to me. Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.
