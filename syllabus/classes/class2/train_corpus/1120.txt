For the quality, the prices ($4-$6) have to be the best in town. The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well. Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but I certainly do. This isn'ta TGIF or Cafe, its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that. Rate a church? Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light. It's a bloody church, for chrisssake! Big, grey and imposing. Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure. The pastor at this church is cool, I met him after some holiday service.
