It was good having the girls down. We played a new version of Uno called "African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging. It's not for the meek. It was incredible what a good player Alena was. She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!). I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy. I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment. Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff. They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment. So he's going to have to start looking for another place.
