Anyway, I was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine, Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette. All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food, is add a whole lot of pepper. Alot. The finest Christmas Trees i've ever seen. I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm. The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding. The owners were entertaining and gracious. I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals. This is one of the best farms I have ever been too. I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast!
