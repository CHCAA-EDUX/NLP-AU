In part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Lake Superior. The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943. Western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done. Their sheep could graze, their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard. After the major kill-offs, wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend. Like UFOs or Sasquatch, several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves, usually in Yellowstone. In the 1960s, a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves, then released them when their shooting was done. If so, this happy band has not been heard from since. Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s, hoping to reestablish a breeding population. If true, the caper failed.
