They were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality. (not church morality, no that is phoney, love thy neighbor ... hell no, kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????) So, hmmmm indeed. I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article. The deathly inversion of truth, ala satanism. I think the jury's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers. Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the 'Church-Morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but doesn't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation. The last I checked, the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed (though false) Christians. Irony is dead...Long live Irony! That's it.
