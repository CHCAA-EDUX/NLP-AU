No wine glasses. Room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink/stove combo that didn't work. Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems. No tub. The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked. Don't get the rooms off the two kitchens. They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything. Free parking. I'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $99, but I wouldn't pay their rack rate. Quit with the overstatements!
