I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns. Just jealous. My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate within the four year period. She still has some sort of scholarship but I am not for sure how much it pays. She is going to be a kinesiologist, sports injury therapist. I think she just wants to be able to touch football players legs. She will be 20 on 11/03. I am really proud of her. Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much. You should e mail her sometimes.
