Denis First Union National Bank Deutsched Bank AG I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're OK. Susan, Joe, The referenced TAGG # was entered as a 'New Counterparty', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure. Thank you, Russell Hey there yourself, Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.
