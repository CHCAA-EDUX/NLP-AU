It is the hospitality from Tom and staff, that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach. We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean. When in Scordia, Sicily If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia. They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet. You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language. You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture, that I have fallen in luv with. I will 4-ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years. Luv always.. I've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs) I would now not recommend this business to anybody.
