When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT!! I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job. I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back. The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it! She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it. I explained I did not get what I paid for. She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job. She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece. I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit. With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS.
