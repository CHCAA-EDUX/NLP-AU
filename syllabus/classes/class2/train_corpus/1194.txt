I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn't budge. Times are hard, I know, but they had no compassion. I called 3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back. I emailed 4 times, never a response. In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing. I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing. I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care. FANFUCKINGTASTIC Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford, England. I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza.
