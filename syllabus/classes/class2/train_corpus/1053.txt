Aka Nowheresville. And this litttle gem of a 7-table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise. A short but wide-ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street. Fantastic food served without pretense, very reasonably priced wine selections. A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting. Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices Boutique stores dealing in children's clothing/gifts are often outrageously priced (who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie?) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose's prices are reasonable (for the SAME products found at other area boutiques, the prices were 20-25% cheaper). The service was also excellent - friendly, helpful and informative without being overbearing. Will definitely return.
