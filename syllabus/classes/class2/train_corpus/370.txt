21/03/2001 18:20 Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business. Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end. The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit. The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF. The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ). The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave. The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues. Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet. The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.
