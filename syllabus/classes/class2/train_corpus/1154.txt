I brought it back with 9000 miles. They "finished" the work and told me the car was ready. I found out they did not even drive the car, stated they looked at it before. They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number. They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan (a seperate issue), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms. I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever. Great Job I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need. Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding. It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us.
