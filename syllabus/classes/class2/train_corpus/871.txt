Patience is the key here. He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training. And always, always train with love and positive methods- never hit or harshly scold. Never train out of fear. You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader, not fear you. Good luck with your puppy! All the best. Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer. :) why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right. or, as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv, get a clicker type thing and treats as well.
