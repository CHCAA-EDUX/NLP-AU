Start up your filter (sponge filters are the best for bettas) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78-82. Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water. If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home. Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface. ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up,they would know Add aquasafe with the water you put in it. Make sure the temperature is good. Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank. Everything else should be good. Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another.
