1579 - EBS Network Co. Division of 17H. This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group. Not currently on our list of companies. I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon). 4 - easy. 1691 - EPI-EBS Europe Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities. Broke out the activities of 1179. A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well. 4 - easy.
