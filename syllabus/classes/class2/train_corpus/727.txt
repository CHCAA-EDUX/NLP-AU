Get your English in order before writing here again please. dead pixel of my photos? just want to ask..i have an nikon dslr..im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200-300percent..i can see some dead pixel...is there something wrong with my camera body? lens? or what? please help me..and what should i do to fix this problem? or it is normal? Are you sure it isn't dirt on the sensor? Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
