Like it or not, for good or bad, we are here. Who are we? We are the downtrodden and dispossesed, the self-torturing, the disenfranchised convicts, drug and alcohol addicts, the unemployed and unemployable. We are the children of poverty, financial and spiritual. We have and will have children of our own, grandchildren too. We are ex-cons, uninsured, homeless, of many colors and speaking many tongues. We are the enemy in what has become a domestic war against ourselves. And who are you? You who like the tough talk of Tough on Crime? You who watch as budgets are cut in education and health care while you militarize a police force?
