To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns/cities, most rural places don't have a bus or train service. You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists. By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way. Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets/boots etc. We only had a few sunny days this summer, barely 24C on a few occasions, more like 14C most days. We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions. Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender. The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter, windier & colder. We had frosts in October so I wouldn't advise visiting late in the year to be honest, Spring time is your best bet. You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland?
