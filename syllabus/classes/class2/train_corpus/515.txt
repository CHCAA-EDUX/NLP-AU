"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.
