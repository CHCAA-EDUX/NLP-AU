We'll have four bands, and Big D is cookin' ..... lots of fun and great prizes. This is an event you don't want to miss!! Bands, food, and prizes are sponsored by Beyond Control, who will be competing in the Band of the Year Contest at the River Front Festival in Cuyahoga Falls on July 1. The winner of this competition will receive $5000, which Beyond Control hopes to win in order to donate it to the Abby Freeman fund. Please help us by logging onto the Rockin on the River website at . Cast a vote for Beyond Control, and help us provide Abby with her life saving treatments again. Donations can also be made through Charter One Bank. Make checks payable to Kendel Bunnell c/o Benefit for Abby Freeman By Richard Spencer (Filed: 19/11/2004)
