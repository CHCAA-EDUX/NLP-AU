Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview. Vince Kaminski Peter Percell <percell@swbell.net> on 04/30/2001 11:16:58 AM I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the SIAM Workshop last Friday. I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly for the oil and gas pipeline industry. I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and mathematical skills. Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline simulation industry would be a plus. Please consider whether I might fit in your group. Your answer to a question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.
