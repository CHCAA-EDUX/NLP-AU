As many of you may have heard, President Bush has nominated a long-time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court. Under our Constitution, this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent, as described in our Constitution, Article II, Section 2. A copy of the Constitution, with links back to the official source, is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position: He has a very high intellect. He graduated very high in his class, from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale. He has a long and distinguished record, including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge, the next level below Supreme Court. He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases, and he can recite details from memory. He demonstrates an excellent "Judicial Temperament," being courteous, mild-mannered, respectful of all people; careful in his work, meticulous in detail. His co-workers love him.
