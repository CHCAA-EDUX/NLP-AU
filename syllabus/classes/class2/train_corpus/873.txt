Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice. Rooms start from 500 per double. Those ones are quite small. Must say, in Delhi it's hard to get good price/quality rating. I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide. It's in an area starting with a P, many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice. But in general, Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price. In Varanasi I don't know. I've stayed in a more expensive hotel there, but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor? Also, while travelling ask people where they've been and if they have any hotel recommendations.
