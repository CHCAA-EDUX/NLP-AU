How rare! Well done. My favorite florist! I came to La Crosse to go to college, and my mom would send me birthday flowers though here. They were beautiful and lasted forever! Now that I live here, this is my favorite place to grab flowers for friends and coworkers! Hands down, best place in the area! I <3 Max's Excellent bagels and excellent service! I go in about every morning to get bagels for myself or my co-workers and the employees at Max's are great!!
