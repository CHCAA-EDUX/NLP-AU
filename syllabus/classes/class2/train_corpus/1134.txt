I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them, they lost my car key. Lucky I had a spare with me! To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one. (These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy, you can't just go to WalMart.) Go to the website for coupons and join the club -you can get free parking. However, with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility, it may be cheaper to park at BNA. Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating. We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked. We were told that we couldn't today because they were closing soon. I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in.
