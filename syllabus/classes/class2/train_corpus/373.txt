Dr. Harris: I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year. I understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this would compensate for my disability. After talking with Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for. I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year. I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test. Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business. I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you.
