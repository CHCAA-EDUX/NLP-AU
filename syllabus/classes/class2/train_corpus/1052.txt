even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude. I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me, or even just give me an approximate price range. He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price. What kind of rude service is that? I don't want to waste my time with them. Top notch eats! So here we are in Manson. Manson? Yes, Manson. Right near Chelan.
