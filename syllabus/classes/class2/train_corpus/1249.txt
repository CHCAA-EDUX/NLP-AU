When we arrived at 5, and left circa 7, there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us. Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience? MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store. At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses. They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses. I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online). So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks. They said they were "unable to tell me until they ordered my dress". Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number. Do other brides fall for this???
