The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls). The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing. The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced. The service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out-of-place flat-screen TV playing football. But I'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut. It's just not worth it. Don't Expect Sleep or Courtesy I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007. At 3:15 am on night #2, the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room. These are not household type alarms.
