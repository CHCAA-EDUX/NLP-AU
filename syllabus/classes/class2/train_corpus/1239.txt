Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego. Dumbest F'ers ever I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU? So I say: I'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square (built in 1926) do you deliver to the Warwick? They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey. I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick. And he says: You're at Warwick in Pennsylvania? and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown. I say, NO, I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square. He says: I not know that town, I have to get to work, I'm in PHILLY.
