We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday. Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch. Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them. I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal. When I went to Bosnia, all the meat was Halal. I will not eat halal meat, so guess what, I opted for foods which weren't a meat dish, there were plenty of other options. I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it. When you go to another country, you live by their way of life and their laws, if you don't like it, you know how to get back out the country (but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away, huh). Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway, they normally have blue for bakery items, red for cooked meat, brown for raw meat, etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies. No.
