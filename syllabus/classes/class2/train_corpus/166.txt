Vince Michael: Thanks for putting the paperwork together. I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now. Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable. The above services provide no value to me personally. If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen. John John - We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.
