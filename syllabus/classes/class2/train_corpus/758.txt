You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the DSL modem connects. Best way to change 35mm film in Holga 120 whilst out and about? I've modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can't wind the film back, you have to open the back of the camera (in a darkroom) to rewind the film. What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling? Do you just take a changing bag with you? Whats the easiest thing? Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution. It's light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera. You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc. It's really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you're outside.
