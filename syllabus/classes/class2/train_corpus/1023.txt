thanks guys goes really well and thaks 4 the cheap price.. excellent, top guys a+++++ reccommend to anyone!!!!!!!!!! Hams on Friendly ... RIP This is the original Ham's restaurant, expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more. Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management. According to news accounts, the company is struggling. I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago. So long Hams ... you will be missed. We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window. Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them.
