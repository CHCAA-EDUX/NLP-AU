In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino, both just 16, disappeared. They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home. The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together. But their parents refused to accept this. Michele Tollis, Fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio's friends. Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story. No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked Michele Tollis It emerged that Chiara, the girl who disappeared with Fabio, had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom. During this search, Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son's disappearance.
