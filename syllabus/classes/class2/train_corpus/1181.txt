Bait and switch, untrained workers Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago, before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile... was told I would need a "dual head concrete grinder" to remove thinset and make a nice "finished" look (ready for concrete stain). Was quoted $55 all inclusive of grinder inserts, etc. No problem, sounded like it's done every day. Will look beautiful. Got the tile ripped out, call today, now all the sudden this grinder won't leave a finished look AND it's $125 PLUS around $75 for the inserts. I can rent another machine for like $60 that will give it a finished look. So from $55 to $260? Are they serious? I feel like they didn't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price?
