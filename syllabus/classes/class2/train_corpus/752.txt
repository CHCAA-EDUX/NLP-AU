Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT!!! would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it cant escape i can buy it a wheel I've never had a dwarf hamster but I've had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can't out. Yes I've had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good Hi This is the cage I have whhich is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from: http://www.petsathome.com/shop/combi-1-dwarf-hamster-cage-by-ferplast-15986 I love this cage, it's easy to clean, very spacious and fun for the hamster
