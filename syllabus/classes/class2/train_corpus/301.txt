It's good chatting with you. Keep in touch! Kyle.Jones@radianz.com 11/29/2000 05:07 PM Tana, I don't understand, what do you mean by "log in an email"? Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had already received Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them that, I don't want them getting swell heads). Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as well as C & D. I think she likes her special room in your house.
