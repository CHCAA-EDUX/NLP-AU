It's really too advanced for a beginner, both in tooling and safety. Just the zinc fumes will get you, if you don't take precautions. Pewter is perfect for what you are doing, and it melts on a stove top. I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point. Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough. I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal (e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal, not barbecue charcoal). I have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but I think your version is just too small and doesn't get hot enough. I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill). I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot.
