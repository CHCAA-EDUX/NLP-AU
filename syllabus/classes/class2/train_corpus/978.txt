Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down. Is that something you are up for? If so go for it and I'll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up. It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk. If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out. As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we've had to deal with it. Pretty much every large stable has here. Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada. We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there. That horse returned to racing and we didn't notice much difference.
