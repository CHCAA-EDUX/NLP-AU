if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside? thanks We took our cat Mitten camping. He loved it. But he was an inside/outside cat (only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats). He was trained to a harness/leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside. If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan, you may have a problem taking her. NO! changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed, mean, sick, or will not want to be around you. What cleaners should I use for dusting around my parakeet?
