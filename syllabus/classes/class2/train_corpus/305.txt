Attached is the referenced agreement. Let me know if the notice information is OK with you. If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature. Thinking about that, what's your title? I'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority... No, it does not mean that. Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement. Our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component. Richard Sage 11/30/2000 10:52 AM
