Well, again, I am now faced with a tax bill of $6,000+, all due on April 15, 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is 'well, you won't have to pay a penalty.' I may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys. In the words of my new accountant, THEY LET ME DOWN! Bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place. Why? Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash. Sketchy, right? Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days. (They even got me a couch pretty quickly.)
