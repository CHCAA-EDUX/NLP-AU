My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town, I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self! Their customer service was perfect! Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted. EVEN IN FRANCE! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere, amazing food, and great customer service! Thank you Roll UP Crepes! This is one of the worst places I have stayed, we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry. Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won't use, it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole. The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager. Bad service starting from the front desk.
