Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds, where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires. They are confined in this way until they finally die. What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment? These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume. Musk, which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive, makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application. (The heat increases their "production" of musk.) Here Kant's rule--"Animals are merely means to an end; that end is man"--is applied with a vengeance. To promote one of the most trivial interests we have, thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives." This article, and specifically this piece, effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic. If anyone is interested in listening to this song, and in offering their opinion, whether it be positive or negative, I'd appreciate it.
