I have a hamster, and mice and rats like to escape. The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster, rat, mouse, or degu. So if you lose him, he is easier to find, because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages. So my opinion is Guinea pigs. (plus they dont stink that bad) Depends on what you want in a pet, to be honest. Also depends on the space you have, how much time you can handle the pet, how much money you can spend, etc. I've had experience with all of those pets except Degus. My favorite would have to be the rat. They're incredibly social, highly trainable, and very clean.
