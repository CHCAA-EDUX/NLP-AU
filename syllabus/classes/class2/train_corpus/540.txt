Posted by Hidden Nook to Hidden Nook at 2/7/2005 01:09:32 AM Healing the Collective Body In George Orwell's influential novel "1984" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "war is peace". I see the merit in flowing with duality. One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one, that there is no separation between you and I, we are all together in this thing called life, we human beings, the birds and the tress, the rocks and the sky, all of it. I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body, mind and soul. Think of all life, if you will, as one great choir or one grand congregation. Our strength is in our unity and harmony. Any major dischord and we all suffer. Any insult to the collective good brings us all down.
