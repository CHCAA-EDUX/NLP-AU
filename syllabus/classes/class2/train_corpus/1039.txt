While I hope I don't have any need for a lawyer anytime soon, if I do I'll definitely use this firm again. Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism (received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details) and the subsequent delivery of my gift (To Split, Croatia) was as requested. The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard. Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery. Danny (Australia) I LOVE MY GYM! FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily. If you are serious about working out in a non-commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be. This is the most humble gym you will every step into.... if you dare to work on your body don't be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be!! Over-rated...
