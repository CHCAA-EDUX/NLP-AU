Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing. He got the pictures back to me quickly. I would highly recommend David to anyone. He will exceed your expectations! He doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there. Not so great My husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month. It's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money. But just this week a peddle broke. He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes??
