Mr. Squeege is THE BEST. Prompt, Clean Windows. Affordable pricing. Friendly responses. How else can excellent be described for a business of this sort? They have been my only "go-to" resource since we first did business together. You will find the same to be true for you. Fantastic Place to buy your next vehicle We have never had a bad experience buying from Edmark. This is car number 3 we've purchased through them.
