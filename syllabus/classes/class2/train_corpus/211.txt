Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)? Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article? With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities. With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide. These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations. I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across. Finally, a question regarding timing. The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers. I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards. And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.
