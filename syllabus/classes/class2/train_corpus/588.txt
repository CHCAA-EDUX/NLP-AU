You can check that out as well, to confirm that this is all real, and for a worthy cause. Abby is our beloved friend, and we are trying to raise money for her any way we can, so this prize money is important to help her continue to receive her life-saving treatments. Many thanks, and may God bless you all and keep you healthy. Here are some emails we have sent, along with the flyer for the Benefit fund raiser we are holding in June, just for your information. Roy, I am sending you some info that I have passed along regarding the effort to win the cash for the fund raising benefit. If you can pass this info along, and ask everyone you know to forward it to their contacts, etc, we may have a shot at pulling this off. Thanks, Fred John,
