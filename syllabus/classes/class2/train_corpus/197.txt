I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one. Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several? I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet). If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me. Thanks, Kay On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed. Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed? Thanks, Kay
