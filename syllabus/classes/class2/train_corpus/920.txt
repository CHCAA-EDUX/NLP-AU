I wouldn't like not having the option to return to NZ. I guess I'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree. But I worked hard and I'm still working hard. There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap. My 2c. .... Get an education! I'm doing fine. Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground, don't assume it's better in Oz. People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20+ years, so it's not anything new. It depends on what you hunger for.
