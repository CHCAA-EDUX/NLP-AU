We don't want it to be too cold (not sure when exactly there fall is... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months), but we don't feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either. We're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier! Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be? People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather, it is unpredictable. One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of. It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February, but winter woollies in March and even during the summer. And then thereâ€™s the rain. Ireland receives a lot of rain, with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year. County Kerry is the worst affected. The southeast is the driest, enjoying a more continental climate.
