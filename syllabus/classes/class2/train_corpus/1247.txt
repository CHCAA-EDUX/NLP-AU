The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service. The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food. It's an entirely up and down experience, however. Now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal. The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you). Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them. That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world. Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order). Dinner was also an up-and-down experience. The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.
