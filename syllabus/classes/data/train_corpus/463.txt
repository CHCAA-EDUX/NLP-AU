Best, Jeff Harry Kingerski 12/26/2000 03:33 PM Jeff - instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim. In general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that. Otherwise, I think you have captured the points excellently. We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months. But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
