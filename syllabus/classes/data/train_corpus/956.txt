THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe". If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial, that is fine. But get the eggs out, maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water. In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container. After a number of people began complaining about "mystery deaths"among incubating eggs, some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7-8 days of incubation, one should do a 100% water change - as the eggs develop, they do release waste material. Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs. Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus, so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper. Other will add a drop of Methylene blue. If an egg turns blue, it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down. Get those out ASAP too.
