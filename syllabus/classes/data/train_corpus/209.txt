We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter ) Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ? Mike Late Jan sounds great. Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion. I believe that these are three weekends in a row, January 6, 13 and 20th. So the last weekend in January would work well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!). Does that work for you? And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday? Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!!
