The best person is the valet. Short of that, avoid this place, as a silver Marriott member, this is a disgrace. BEST PLACE IN AMES I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean, and in great condition! I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex, also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful. The fitness center was GREAT! The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin, sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations. I would recommend these apartments to anybody! I absolutely LOVED living there. The Best Service Ever!!
