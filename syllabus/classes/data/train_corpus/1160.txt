I'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life. By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist. My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me! It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment. At the front door of his office, I nearly turned around. I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did. Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with. They made me feel confident in what they would do, and treated me like a member of their own family. I never felt pain or discomfort. The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life.
