Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments. We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised. There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th. The forum is expected to be invited testimony only. Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel. The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom. Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions. Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone. I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet?
