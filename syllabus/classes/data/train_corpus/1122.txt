but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review It was a Saturday and my spring was broken... I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh-so pleasant and helpful! She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday! I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair. I enjoyed speaking with Dan, and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors. The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair. I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors. Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service. Roger M., Woodinville
