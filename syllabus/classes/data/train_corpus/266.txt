Are either of you familiar with this project? We have had no contact with the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any structuring goals. Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work. I now understand that someone at ENA/Enron Mexico/Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project. I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response. JWVS Hello Janice: I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad. It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly. These are always difficult times.
