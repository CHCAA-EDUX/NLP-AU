1. Be responsible. Do all your chores without being nagged, take care of any existing pets, keep your room clean, and so on. Prove, to your parents' satisfaction, that you, not they, will be the one actually taking care of your new pet. 2. Save up, and research, so that you are ready for your new pet. 3. Bargain with them. Offer to do extra chores, ask for your pet as a reward for good grades, something like that. 4. Play the sympathy card. If you can find a pet at a shelter, or that a friend needs to get rid of because they're moving or whatever, you might be able to talk your parents into "giving it a good home" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet. On the fear angle--talk her into coming to the pet store with you. Once you're there, ask if you can hold a ball python.
