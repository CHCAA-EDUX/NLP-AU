01/11/2001 02:42 PM After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we've done. If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP. pls print. df In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers. However, as you will see, the questions I thought of got kinda long- but I think we need answers for all of them. One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I've listed. Please provide me your thoughts asap. MK
