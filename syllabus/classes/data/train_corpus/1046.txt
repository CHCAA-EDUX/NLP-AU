I have used these guys for new snows, fixing lots of flats, used replacement tires, and oil changes. They have the best prices locally and good customer service. One guy is a little surley, but who gives a crap as long as your car's work is outstanding. AND they're usually able to help you as a walk-in, and they're fast. Overall-good stuff. Another great business bites the dust! The best cakes EVER! A bit pricey, so I didn't go very often, but it was always a treat when I did. The prices were worth what I got. I'm assuming they are completely out of business since I can't find any contact information.
