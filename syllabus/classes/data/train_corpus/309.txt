Also, I'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter Julie. Needless to say I am very excited. Talk to you guys soon, Susan Hey girlie, How are you doing? Haven't heard from you in a while. A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul. Are you really? Would you come with your parents or separately?
