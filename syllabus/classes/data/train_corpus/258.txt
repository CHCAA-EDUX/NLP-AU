I have a change in plans next week. My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, so I will be heading that way on Monday. I was planning to be on vacation anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I would not have had otherwise. I will manage client expectations accordingly. Kay I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal. Is that ok with you? Lorie Leigh @ ECT 03/15/2001 04:17 PM Conference Plus will be hosting this call:
