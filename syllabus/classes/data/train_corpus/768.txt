can anybody tell me if the metro runs directly from CDG to montparnasse? if not what transfers should i get on? ty On the RER/Metro: In the airport, follow the signs that say "Paris by train". Buy a ticket for Paris. This will get you on the RER B line going into town. Stay on it until the "Saint-Michel Notre-Dame" station. Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "Porte d'Orleans". Get off at the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.
