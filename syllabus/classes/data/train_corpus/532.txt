Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half a day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance, legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback about our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting. The real focus of the meeting will be on how we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B marketplaces.? We are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment. We would like to meet between November 14 and?December 1?since construction of our services is already underway.? Please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions (978-376-9004). ? Thanks. -> Gerry
