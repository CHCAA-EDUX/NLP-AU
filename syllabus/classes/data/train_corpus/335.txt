I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $10M for each party, but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly. Let me know if this is your understanding, as well. After you have had the chance to review the attached, please send me a marked-up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there. Should you have any questions, feel free to call me. I can be reached at 315-460-3344. Any credit concerns can be discussed with Dennis Goldmann, who can be reached at 315-460-3349. I look forward to hearing from you.
