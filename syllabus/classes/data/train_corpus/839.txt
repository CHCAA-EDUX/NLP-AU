You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice. http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1052.html Above is the link to the Department of State travel website, which will give you all the info that you need, including passport information. It is free. I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U.K. You should be fine with just a passport, unless you're staying longer than six months. You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though. I am not sure how well you planned this trip. You'll have a great time, so no worries there. I visited London, Edinburgh, and St. Andrews so far, and I was treated very well and with great kindness.
