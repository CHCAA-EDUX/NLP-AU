My insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine. Then I got a bill for $483.00. The doctor's office said that payments had been "reversed". Blue cross has no record of aa reversal. The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC/BS. They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter. I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid, but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $160.00 has come through. It was an ingrown toenail. How much could it possibly cost? Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe, the office staff is rude to boot.
