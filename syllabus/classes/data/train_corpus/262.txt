Please verify that the titles are correct for everyone in your group. The ones that I made changes to are in red. Thanks, Paula. I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet. Please use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier. Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon tomorrow. It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file is accurate, including titles, as this information is being given directly to John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen. Thanks, Paula.
