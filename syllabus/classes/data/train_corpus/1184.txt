The food is excellent, the serivce is horrible. I think they're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking... not in any hurry. In my experience the food has been excellent (for the most part). However, the bartenders/waitresses definately need to be re-trained (if they ever had any to begin with) and learn two things: only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting. In some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just doesn't care/know better. They must also get something to keep take-out warm, so it's not room temperature at best when you get it home. You just have to know what you're getting into when you go. Nice local pub, excellent food (especially wings), and don't go if you have a limited amount of time. Trust The Midas Touch I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles, I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else!
