They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit. I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone. They refused. Terrible communication as well. At one point they told me the dog had been fixed, the next day it hadn't. Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure. College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE! Went to the school here OVER PRICED!!!!!! You do NOT learn the things you were promised. You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate!
