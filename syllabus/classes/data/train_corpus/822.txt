where would you go? I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help!!!! definitely London - you speak the language and will have more fun. The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad. London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around. You will be able to have a good time there. % As you're from the States you'll have much more fun in London. Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners.
