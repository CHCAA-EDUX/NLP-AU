When they start bleeding that means they're really fighting. If they're going kinda slow and like fake biting (not biting as hard as they can), and fake scratching (not hitting as hard as they can with their paws) then they're playing. I have two cats, and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial, but now they do fight and play. The difference is when the cat hisses, that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away. That means they are fighting. When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing. I can see how you get confused though. :) What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive? When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half-million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam. He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years (before the next election in 1968).
