All I can say is that I am glad I went in! The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful. This place is about healing, not making a buck. The followup visit is FREE!! After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I won't be back here!! I will be back and telling EVERYONE about this clinic. THANK YOU!! I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted (a reball) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price. Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty. It was a no brainer really.
