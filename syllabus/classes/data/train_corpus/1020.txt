This was a flavorful, enjoyable meal for both of us. Rude Rude Rude went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake! she didnt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it! i wont go back! she needs to develop a personality ! brought dog home and its all choppy now! It's helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting. If you watch a lot of fights (youtube) and research some of the history (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more! Also after seeing a handful of bullfights, I can say that they're a lot more enjoyable if you're smashed (BAC>= .15).
