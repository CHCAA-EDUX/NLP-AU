So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend. She loves giraffes and homemade things! I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture. I don't have much money so I bought Crayola Air-Dry Clay. I have sculpted the giraffe laying down. The key is...I have a few problems: 1. I tested it out by making a figure boat And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile! (like VERY not in a good way) Is there any way to strengthen it?
