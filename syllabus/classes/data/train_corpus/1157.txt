The instructor did not show up! We waited until 2:25 PM and then left. There were 2 in our group, and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class. Well, not much I can say except I'm very disappointed with this experience. This was our first visit to your studio. In today's instant world, there's no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e-mail if she was going to be late. As a yoga studio, I'm sure you're all aware that all actions generate karma â€¦ and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google. Finest?? Really??
