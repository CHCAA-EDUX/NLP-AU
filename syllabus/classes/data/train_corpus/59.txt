In fact, it would tend to encourage more organized anti-India outfits, such as the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and outside-linked Maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken India's eastern flank. Indian intelligence's lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling. This formidable enemy, which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid-1980s, has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time. In 2001, according to Indian army officials, security forces launched a wide-ranging operation in the 300-some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar, and found huge caches of arms. The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "other terrorist groups". The search-and-destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo. In addition, LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers. The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now-defunct Asiaweek in 2001. A shipment of weapons, ammunition and explosives, believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars, left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex-Joux 3. As is LTTE standard procedure, the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon.
