After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda. Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave...saying it's the best look I've ever had. Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius. Looks like there's a lot of talent in this place. Worth every penny. My Favorite place at Wildwood I have been going to the Wildwood, NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first. I rated it 5 stars. I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel. I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood, this hotel has everything that we are looking for.
