I seem to remember something about 'by their works shall ye know them." I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old 'Rock-N-Roll made them do it' argument. Whie I don't subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior (which I think is patently rediculous), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on. Sub-cultures (as the lable implies) do not develope in a vacuum. Again, I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos, and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly. These people are dangerous wether they're head-banging to 'Canibal Corpse' or humming along to 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. (The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic....) I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence, forgiveness, and charity, but it's important to remember that Christians (or 'Smartwolves') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle. Peace. The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns, and then 200,000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus.
