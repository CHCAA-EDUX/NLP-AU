Is there a future for our nation's youth? @Ryan B, I'm two years into an undergraduate degree. Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available. Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas, to Australia, etc. There's obviously a reason for that (lack of employment, low incomes, etc.) Your answer doesn't do anything but remind me that I'm going to be $25,000 in debt by the time I'm 22. So, thanks. @W.a.b.b.y, I really like you're answer.
