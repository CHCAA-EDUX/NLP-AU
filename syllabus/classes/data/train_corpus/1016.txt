It is very clean, staff is friendly, and I have never waited! I go every other week for the shallac/gel manicure which is only $25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks! I love it. Pedicures are also great. Try this place out! I promise you will not be disappointed! Amazing Pictures at an Amazing Price Rendy is totally amazing. She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable. She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures, not only of me, but of my family and friends.
