Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information. We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution. Grand-standing is ignored. Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored. Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored. Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations. Thane and I also visited with him. Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed. (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)
