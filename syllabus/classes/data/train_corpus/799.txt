My breyers need stables or barns though.....and I need directions and materials on how to make them. I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit. And I need to know where to buy the materials. Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good. Pictures would help! NOTE:If i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then Breyer horse , miniature/ model replica sketch out floor plan, estimate size, draw front view, side view, and 3d orthographic perspective views, figure out how many stalls you want, then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse, measure size for platform, draw lines and mark sections, measure out wall sections and height,
