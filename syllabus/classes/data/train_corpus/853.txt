No. There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time--the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China, there were lots of Japanese who'd been displaced during WWII. The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black. The Mission was basically latin-american. As the southeast asians and philipinos came over, they added to the cultures. So, the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time--caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that's because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that's who the photographers took pictures of. The other ethicities weren't well represented in politics yet--or rather, they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70's due largely to the more open-minded hippy generation. Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs. It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact. You never saw black MUNI drivers, Asian police, Latino politicians until then.
