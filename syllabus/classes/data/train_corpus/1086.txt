Well done to Brendan and the team! Gold award parts excellence, metro. Well done to Jason and the team! simple but perfect IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes, this is not the place for you. If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients, you'll love Vetri. Hands-down the best pasta and gnocchi I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot). The antipasti were amazing, the wines were mind-blowing, the service couldn't have been better. I've dined at lots of high-end restaurants and I've never before felt my money was so well spent. Great Prices, Great service!
