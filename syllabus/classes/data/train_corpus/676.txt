The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties (6, number of the Beast). It came from Liverpool, that was the port base to the Titanic, destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith (also from Liverpool): "Not even God can sink my ship" (not only the captain, but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool).

Some months later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon's bruises. John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer. The same demons that made captain Smith say "Not even God can sink my ship" spoke from antichrist John Lennon (from Liverpool, base port to the Titanic) saying: "Christianity is on the go.
