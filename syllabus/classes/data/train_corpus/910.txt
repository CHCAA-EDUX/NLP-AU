Did your vet take radiographs (x-rays)? 2) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn't think it would be helpful. 3) If he shows no interest in water, then take him back to your vet. It could be due to nausea or any number of things. He could become severly dehydrated (especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea). From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems. And being dehydrated, vomiting, and having diarrhea just doesn't feel good. 4) Call your vet. They should have discussed a bland diet with you, including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting. It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized, and put on IV fluids to help his hydration, administer the antibiotics IV, and to ensure that he starts to recover.
