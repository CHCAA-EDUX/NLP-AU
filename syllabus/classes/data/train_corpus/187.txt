I will be looking for one or more of the following. My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like. I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities). They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it. I want signed and numbered. I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision. I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive. For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper. At least that is what I am thinking now. Bonnard (colorful only)
