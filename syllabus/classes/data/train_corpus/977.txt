I know this is going to be expensive. I'm willing to give it a shot. Gallop, I've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well. Looked at studies, treatment options and such. I will have the EPM test done before treating. The chiro/acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM. If that is the case then acupuncture isn't going to hurt him. It's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals (and a bunch of Yahoos) before you decide to take this horse on. I do think some Y!A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
