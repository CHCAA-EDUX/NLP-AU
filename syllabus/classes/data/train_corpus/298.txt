- MEH-risk Oct 20.doc I'm working on it now. Maybe we (Enron) could review it tomorrow morning, then send it to FCE. I can meet around 10:00. That way, we can get it to them in time for weekend review. Does that work? Kay It was good to hear from you! We had a nice Thanksgiving here too. It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.
