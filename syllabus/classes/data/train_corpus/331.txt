This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday, 6th July, to our triplets: Benjamin James - at 12.45 pm - 3 lbs 4 ozs Toby William - 12.46 pm - 4 lbs Hannah May - 12.48 pm - 3 lbs 15 ozs. Although small, they are all "fully functioning" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care (and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights. Emma is fine, too - very well!! All the best and kind regards Mark OOPS! Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you.
