I may want to put some steers or heifers up there. I am going up soon and having the tractor fixed. Reggie said he will pay us soon. He also still wants the tractor if we can hold on to it. First come, first serve. When is the wedding? We're set for 11/01/01. Be sure to take your sweety out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon. It was sure beautiful coming up last night. We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket and watch for the space shuttle.
