John. John - I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold. Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce. I'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73. Call me if you're interested.
