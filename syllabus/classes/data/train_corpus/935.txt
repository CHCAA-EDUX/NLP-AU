I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35% more light/heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well-being of him. My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat, but the "sun rays" he needs? I also was wondering how long should this light be on. The lady at pet smart said 4 hours, but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours. He's getting used to his new home, but hasn't eatin yet. I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze- dried crickets. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. Let me try to break this down as simply as I can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," UVA, UVB, and heat. Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA, including heat bulbs, that's the easy one to provide for.
