1. Social Media. We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies, but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing. 2. We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators. How has it gone so far? Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on Facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional. We are absolutely confident that Stuart's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program. Finally, it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator. Excellent service and quality I had Hom-Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago. The excellent windows have performed without any problems, but that's not why I'm writing my review.
