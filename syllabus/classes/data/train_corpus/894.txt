We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road. We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it. How could we make it settle in a new house. you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory. territory is very important to cats, and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators, or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so. you will need to give him only a small place to explore, so he can make it his territory, and feel safe there. then, he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared. you will need to get his box and bowls, and whatever blanket and toys are his, and smell like home, and put him in a room. the room you sleep in is best (seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK), but others will work just as well. close the door, and keep him in there for a week.
