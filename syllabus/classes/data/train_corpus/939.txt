Please help me! oh and please say y one is better thx!!!!!! Hi there, Please choose the parakeet... Heres my reason..... I did the same thing that you did for christmas. I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas. At first it was all cool and all. They were chirping and doing their every day business. After a couple of weeks I got tired of them.
