His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L.L.C. However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron's interests. 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement.
