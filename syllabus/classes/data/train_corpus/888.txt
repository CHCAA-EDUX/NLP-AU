We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner. We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty, but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise. Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have. They both had pools for kids and adults. We liked the Liberty's pools better because one had a slide. If you have kids, this would be something that they would definitely enjoy. Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it. We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas. Usually you can't go wrong when getting a spa treatment...... Royal Caribbean is better, but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas.
