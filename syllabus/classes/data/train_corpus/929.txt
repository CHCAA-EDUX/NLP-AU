that will help to reassure him, and he will be less aggressive with her. when they play fight, they don't hiss. if they hiss, they are not playing. if they bite, and one cries, you must separate them, and you must keep an eye on them. hissing is OK, unless they start to fight. if that happens, separate them, and give them time apart. putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid, and she will relax. good luck! A hiss is basically a "get the f*ck away" sound. It means they've gone too far.
