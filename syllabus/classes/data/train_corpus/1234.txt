But we don't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT. Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them. We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road. We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back. They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted. We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls. And every entree we have ordered is perfect. Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive. The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with.
