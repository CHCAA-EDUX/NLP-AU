He's not lame, but he's been having issues. Here's what the owner has said: I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3-4 months ago. I chalked it up to possible nerve damage, because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems. So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels. I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday (I expected him to drop some). He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day. Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems. He can eat all his feed and doesn't drop any, but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it. He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle.
