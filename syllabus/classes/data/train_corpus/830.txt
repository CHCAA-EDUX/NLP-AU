I have to scrub the floor 2-3 times a week now. What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first? I love her and want to help her but I don't know when I'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help. First of all, I am very sorry to hear you're having this issue with your cat. :( Frequent urination is a sign of several things. Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones, but these usually are frequent visits, with small amounts of urine being passed. If there is blood in the urine, or the cat seems to be in pain, then that is also a good indicator. But your cat is passing a LOT of urine, and this is bad. Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney, I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease, which untreated can lead to possible renal failure. Signs of this can be hard to spot, and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet.
