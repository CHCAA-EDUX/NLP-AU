How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays? I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today. He's a good kitty, just when he plays he bites REALLY hard. Almost every day he'd even wake me up like 5am in the morning, trying to bite my arm. And when I move it I guess he figures I'm playing. x.x I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together, and keep it that way til he panics. That seems cruel to me though. Any other way?? Do you think he's teething? It's getting out of hand.
