With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan, there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home. Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban. Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief. Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues. Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan. Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad. “There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official. Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim. ‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National Security Directorate.
