I'll believe it when I see it. Seems like a good idea to keep the heat on Hoecker & Co.right up until Nov. 1. Thanks. I'm glad they want to follow-up with Steve (I've been pushing it) and I've got some follow-up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on Friday with folks post-call. Let's regroup on Monday. I'll be in Portland but can call you. Best, Jeff Jeremy Meier <jermeier@earthlink.net> 10/29/2000 11:48 AM
