just my two cents. thanks for listening. Please take a moment to read this. I realize that it may sound strange, but we are desparate in our efforts and are willing to try anything to help our dear sick friend. This costs absolutely nothing, and will take about one minute of your time. This is not a hoax, as so many of these emails actully are. In quick summary, Beyond Control, a local band in our area, is sponoring a benefit for a cancer victim whose benefits have run out. That band is involved in a local competition which promises a $5000 first prize, which they would like to win in order to donate it to the benefit fund which they have started. Below are some emails to friends explaining a little more about this effort. What we are trying to do is solicit votes for the band, in order to put them in first place.
