My family loves coming to Endo Sushi.They are very nice, it is never crowded, and the food is wonderful, very delicious and fresh! Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront, and it is on a one-way street, but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded. If you cannot park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center's garage, and walk up to Endo Sushi. The service is fast. Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal! (it's by the door, on the hostess stand) Horrible Service! I got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5-10 minutes late. I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5:30. Rude, unprofessional, just jerks.
