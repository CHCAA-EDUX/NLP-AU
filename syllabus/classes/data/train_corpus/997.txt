Their store is dusty, dirty and feels like you're stepping into the 1970s. They don't take coupons. They have a credit card minimum. This place is the opposite of QuikTrip: crappy in every way. Where else can you go for $10 and recieve this treatment?! Awesome haircut at awesome price right here in Palatine! Who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave! I've had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons/barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut! Baffled by the one-star reviews I don't get it.
