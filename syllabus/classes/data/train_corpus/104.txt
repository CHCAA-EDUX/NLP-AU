Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers. "I am, therefore I think" :) Reporting from the town where Susan Polk's trial is going on. I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer's market and music event. Lo and behold, the Mormons were there with a booth. Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program. Just give your email and/or phone number to these guys and they'll track down your family. I was amazed at the spiel they delivered. Kindly young men, but utterly programmed and brain-dead. I resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think.
