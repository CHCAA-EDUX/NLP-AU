Now back to what's really important...you. Thought you'd like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and your needs. Ted Noble 08/16/2000 10:56 AM AAAAAGGGHHHHHH... I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode. This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire. I know I need some of your organizational skills. I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 (I better not fail it). How's life on 32 today -- well that's enough about you let's talk more about me.
