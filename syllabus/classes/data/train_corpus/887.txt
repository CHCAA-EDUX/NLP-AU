The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee (the north coast of Haiti). We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines. Shows Each night there are a variety of shows. Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward. We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better. On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act. If you love seeing the shows, Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians. Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas. We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas. Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades.
