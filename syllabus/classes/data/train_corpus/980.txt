I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM. I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now, but it may be sometime before those results are released. Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile? West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn't always include a fever. Let us know what you decide to do. You hate to see talent get wasted, but honestly I don't think I could take in a horse right now these issues. Personally I think you should just keep on walking by. You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not. If you have a good repoire (which I'm sure you do) with them, they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree... not really sure what you want to do with him... Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh, there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future.
