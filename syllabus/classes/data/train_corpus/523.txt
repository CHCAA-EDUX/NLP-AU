(b) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you? Please give me a call if you would like to discuss. Justin Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time. Michelle and Ken, were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If you got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.
