So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price. Which was very expensive. He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off?? Trek is not so great Only Concerned With Money I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect. The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but I was disappointed with their customer service. Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency. It's pretty ridiculous! They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident!!!!
