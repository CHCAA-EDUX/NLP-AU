There isn't much to see in the delta, it's a lifestyle not a resort area. If you're adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho (near where we live) or Can Tho. From either of those cities, you can venture out and spend a day in the country. Most of the tourists that I've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront. You take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists. The countryside is very beautiful, especially if you have a few months (or years) to get to know the place. PS, If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre, stay a night at my friend Ken's hotel. It's called Kiwi Heaven and it's across the river from Cho Ben Tre. It's a little hard to get to by foot, they're rebuilding the bridge, but you can get someone to moto-taxi you there for a dollar or less. He's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he's been in town for awhile.
