"They would get in line in front of the Russians. And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch." Pike's concern is based on China's development of a new medium-lift rocket, the Long March V, and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. The two developments, he said, could eventually enable China's space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home. mark.carr...@chron.com Email: "righter"<righ...@sonic.net> Groups: alt.animals.rights.promotion, alt.animals, alt.animals.cat, alt.animals.ethics.vegetarian, alt.animals.lion, alt.animals.tiger, alt.animals.felines.diseases, alt.animals.dog, alt.animals.horses.breeding, alt.animals.felines.snowleopards I'm a member of a local animal rights news, and get regular emails from other members and the staff. Recently, I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires, so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes.
