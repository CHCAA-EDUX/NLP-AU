Hundreds of people are feared dead in Mississippi, and the Louisiana city of New Orleans is badly flooded. The city mayor said rescuers were unable to retrieve the dead. "They're just pushing them aside," he said. Amid worsening conditions, officials plan to evacuate a New Orleans stadium where up to 20,000 people took shelter. The Superdome stadium is without power, and toilets are overflowing.
