HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Absolute horrible service from the parts department. They are very rude over the phone and in person. They talk down to you like they are supreme beings, if you hate your job so much then quit!! How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing. I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again. Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city. this is a good place I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great. They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty.
