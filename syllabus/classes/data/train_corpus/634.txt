"You say, 'wow!' An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow." This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone. More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver, for instance. Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park's northern range before the wolves returned, now there are nine. "It may be uninteresting to a lot of people," Beschta told Blue Planet. "There's a lot of impact on plants and they say, 'Who cares?' But we've been looking at streamside communities. Since wolf recovery, streamside plants, willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers, a whole variety of avian species, berry-producing shrubs that bears can use.
