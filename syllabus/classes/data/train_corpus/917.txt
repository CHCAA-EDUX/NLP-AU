it's very logical. I've also considered becoming a teacher, but it's not a job I'm cut out for. I also wish I'd applied for a scholarship. I didn't think I'd be awarded one, but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school, so my chances were probably better than I thought they were. Obviously I'm still completely stupid though. I mean, I wasn't smart enough to apply for a scholarship. And yes, I am being melodramatic. Lol. @Hatmanone, *gasps* So I wouldn't make a good prostitute?
