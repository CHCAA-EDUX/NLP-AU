These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand...better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO. The First One Is much Better! I Have This Exact Cage, Bought From The Exact Ebay User. Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats, But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :) is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake? i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side. im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway. from my understanding, if its heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but it has better heat distribution if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well? what are your suggestions and opinons?
