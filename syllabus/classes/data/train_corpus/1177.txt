I can tell she really cares and wants to help. I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau. Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer. An Asset to Richmond For a long time, one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first-run multiplex. Bowtie has filled that role nicely. The theatre is in an old brick warehouse, which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium. The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there. The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood. There's plenty of parking, and I've never had an issue with audience members who won't stop talking or answering their cellphones.
