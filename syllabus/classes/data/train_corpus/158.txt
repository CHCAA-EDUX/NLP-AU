The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory, with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances. Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion, it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr. Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case.

Maureen, Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you. He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed. Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used. I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.
