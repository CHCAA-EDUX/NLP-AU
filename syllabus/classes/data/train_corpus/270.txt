Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them. There are three possible dates for the meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Here are the dates: Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for you: ___________ Thursday, September 14 5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Monday, September 25 5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm Many thanks, Jeff Garten Good morning, Kitty -
