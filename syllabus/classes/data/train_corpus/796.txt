At 18 years, your cat has had a long life. Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11-15 years. Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues, so your cat has done very well. Male cats very seldom live past 14-15 years. Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare. Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I've ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional. By comparison, outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3-7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment. According to a couple sources, the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon, England who reportedly live to the age of 36. I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21. Anything after 12 is a bonus.
