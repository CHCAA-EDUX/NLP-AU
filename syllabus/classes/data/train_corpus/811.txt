Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock. SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea, including minimum safety equipment, practices, and standards, lifeboats, navigation practices, fire protection, and so on. We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS, and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy, the adoption of SOLAS is probably it. http://www.caribbean-cruising.net -------------------------------------------------- Edit: Also I forgot to mention earlier, most (if not all) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly, and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port. This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed, but makes the crew proficient at launching them. I don't think so Don't worry. When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking?
