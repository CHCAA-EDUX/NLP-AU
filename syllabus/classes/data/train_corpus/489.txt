lemelpe@NU.COM 05/25/2001 10:44 AM Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format. I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA, and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well. As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions. Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week. Phyllis Lemell Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Rhonda L Denton
