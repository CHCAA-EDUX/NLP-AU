Caroline Abramo@ENRON 03/02/2001 10:46 AM what do you think? Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold. If possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz. We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz. We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement. The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral. The 20 mill reflects gross exposure.
