11/28/2000 11:34 AM Richard, How does this look? If I can get a few minutes with Mark H. today, I'm going to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before Thursday's meeting with LIPA. Thanks for your help this morning. Steve In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact Michelle. Michelle Blaine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
