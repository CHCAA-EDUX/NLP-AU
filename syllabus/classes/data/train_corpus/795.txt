Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don't plan on making another one for a while. I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don't know what Sony has said about playstation but again, if you get an Xbox (which I personally think is the best anyways) you should be set for a while. What is the typical lifespan of a cat? My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill. In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened. I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live, however different sources give wildly different lifespans. My cat is 18 years old. In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live? Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at? from my experience with my cats 13-18 years depending on the breed.
