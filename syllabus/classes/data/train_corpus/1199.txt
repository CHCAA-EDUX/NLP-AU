their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls. its like a pizza roll, but they just toss ham and cheese inside. it seems like its healthier too, but its prolly not. also, you can call em ahead of time, and then go to pick up ur food, or have it delivered**. that cuts down on teh wait time, cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting. it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna, as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix. their pizza was a little salty for me, but its still good. they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for +32 delicious. anyways, the mezza luna: you should try it. it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger.
