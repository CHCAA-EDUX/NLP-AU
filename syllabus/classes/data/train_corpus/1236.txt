Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING!! He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis. I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008. Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery (as he had twice stated i must agree to). He later said that by 2 months he "meant at least two months". Two months and at least two months are totally different things. He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer, which i would have. A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed. He also never even said he was sorry.
