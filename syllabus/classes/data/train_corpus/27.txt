"The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [unlike India] to underwrite any arrangement," Kalkat told IPS in an interview. In 1987, the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure. Under the accord, a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east. However, differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force. About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict. India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a strong critic of Indian mediation. Last June, an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$4.5 billion. Japan's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released, came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man. He complained about the "visible lack of progress" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides. The Tigers' chief ideologue, Balasingham, sniffed at the proposal saying that "a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences, but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces."
