Sorry about that, I was working on the Teco O&M costs. Thanks Ben Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see associated with the heat rate spread option. I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked. As such, please provide the following detail: Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options? What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub? Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to value the deal? What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
