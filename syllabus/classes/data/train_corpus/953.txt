If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop. Checkout the second source. I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs ,more easily and the fish look better next to them. Use a well rinsed medicine vial, a cork, new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float them. There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks, picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated, seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there. If you have the room to separate the male(s) & females(s),& feed them well on live foods, (assuming that you are doing weekly 50% water changes) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs. Just making up examples, but if a pair is constantly together, they may lay 10-15 eggs a day. With extra blackworms and maybe frozen (defrosted, rinsed) frozen foods earlier in the day, they may leave 30-40 eggs at a time. Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff, they may produce more. Separating a pair some time before a show (killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs) will encourage them to court and show their best colors.
