Marie Rebecca: I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts. I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer. Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp. likes their resolutions drafted than we are. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else. Marie x33907 Turn up your sound a bit. Hi, Liz: Thanks!
