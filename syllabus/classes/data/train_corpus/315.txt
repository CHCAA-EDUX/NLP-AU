GILBERGD@sullcrom.com 07/14/2000 02:18 PM As we discussed, the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue: EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for the connection of "T1" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access. Direct access connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through internet access.
