If you keep the cage clean they don't smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them, just massage it into their coat and groom them. Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT! Need Advice!? I wanted to volunteer and help animals, and decided to try fostering kittens. This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end. I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment. They track poop everywhere (most disgustingly my bed....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything, including my bare legs! My legs and hands are just full of scratches. I realize they are young and that cats do climb, but this is just ridiculous. My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice.
