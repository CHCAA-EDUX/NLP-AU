I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A-team or even full-time. But this location has the worst weekend staff I've seen EVER. Skip te rest - this is the best Absolutely great ! Clean, updated room, friendly staff, safe location. Staff is super friendly, treat you as a friend. Cannot ask for a better experience. Will be staying here any and every time I come anywhere near. Overall, Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot. PHOTOS DONE WELL
