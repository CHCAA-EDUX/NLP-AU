or is it better if I wait till I get there? If I wait, would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours? Also, any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well. Thank you! If you want reliable and inexpensive... try Sinh Cafe/Tourist. The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district. I have taken this tour and it was great. I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful. I don't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was. Also, Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable.
