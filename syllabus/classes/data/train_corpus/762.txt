I am only familiar with Morton's and Ruth Chris. I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has. I hope you get your answer. Anyway, have a lovely first anniversary! HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ? in his cage in the bathroom ? or would the steam from the shower be a problem ? thanks d If space is minimal, or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets, then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there. There are some things to consider though...
