We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days. ****sigh**** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really! Can someone please make me feel better about this trip!!!! A least your going.! Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all.! and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places, i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go. :D Well, I mean, you don't have to be mad about it. At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY. And, having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family. "Nothing Gold Can Stay", honey.
