First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess. Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to? Like you can pick the destinations? But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere. 1. Here's a site that lists world cruises including prices. http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1 Prices listed, however, are usually based on two people in a cabin, and you will likely face some high "single supplement" costs in addition. (Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard, so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone. You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete). 2. Short of chartering your own ship and crew, I don't see any way you could customize your own itinerary.
