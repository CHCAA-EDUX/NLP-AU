He'll set up a real tour of the area for you, not some tourist fantasy. Have a good trip where-ever you end up. We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip, but they do offer this one day separately. We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies, visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm, rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout. Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different. yoga and horses.....? I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is. I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga. But there are just so many poses and programs! Any good poses or programs (I'm willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $20) to help specifically with leg stabilization?
