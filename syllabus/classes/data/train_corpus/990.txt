They are friendly and fast. I have never had a problem with their hours because I always go during the mornings. They are great! prepared the road test with a driving ... prepared the road test with a driving school in edmonton, but my instructor only trained me in a narrow street, hence I took one 90 minute lesson from the Noble driving school to learn the skill of changing lane, and found them very friendly and professional. Great Doctor! Dr. Faris is a great doctor! I would recommend him to anyone. I was experiencing severe back pain to the point I could barely walk or even bare to sit. I went from a pain scale of 8-9 to 0 and I was able to run in the Crim just a week later!! happy customer
