Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization? If possible, can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5? Thanks, Patty I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group. 18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion. The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities. There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation. 86M - Enron Net Works LLC
