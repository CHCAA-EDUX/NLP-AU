Just Autos Thank you! Was fast and easy, Just had our car returned this morning, I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure. They certainly know what they are doing. The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems, he explained the problem and was very up front and honest, it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working (he explained it better). They phoned the same day, confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job, I gave the go ahead. Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well... ever its like driving a new car. So yes, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs,Thank you Just Autos for your help. I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery. I must say, I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge, & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass! I had a sampler of IPA, Brawler, Love Stout & ESA.
