Kathy and Stewart, the proprietors were the epitome of perfection. Delightful, hospitable, superb,cozy and comfortable. I hope to be back! junkie lube?! really weird place, I was driving home from work thought I'd stop in for an oil change and well, there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze. The neon lighting sign still said "on" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch, more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they'd be open tomorrow. I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was. WOW! grey shirt "mark" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing..... A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here.
