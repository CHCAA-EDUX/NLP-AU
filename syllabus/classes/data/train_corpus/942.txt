(think of a balding man lol) Look for clean feathers. If you want a boy the cere (the nostrils piece above the beak) must be blue. The girl has either pink or brown. I would recommend that you get two parakeets. But get either one male and one female, or two males. Do not get two females. They sometimes dont get along (you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though, two girls tend to fight a lot. I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy. They are the best! If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them.
