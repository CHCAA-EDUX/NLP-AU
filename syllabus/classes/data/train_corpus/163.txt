Beth has made our reservations for the Round Table Friday night (5/18) at Sullivan's Steak House for 6:30. See you all there - this is ling overdue Paula FYI Vince Anne, Mike will call you regarding Sarah. Vince, As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group. However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena. Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.
