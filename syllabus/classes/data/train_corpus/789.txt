The phones and networks are compatible, so the only reason it wouldn't work would be if you have, say, a cheap cell phone company.. Yes you can, but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan. Ye$ you can Text in CANADA to the U$ on a U$ number. Thi$ $ervice will co$t. It varie$ company to company. You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada. Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text. Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection. $ometime$ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie$involved what $ome of your money. Hope you unde$tood the me$$age I do have an "S" key on my computer.
