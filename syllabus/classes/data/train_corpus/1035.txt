We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close. Got the crab rangoon which was great, tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good. Def going to come back and try this place again. Bea was really nice and asked how the food was. Cute place also As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food.
