They can do tricks and they arent messy. The whole family loves them. My parents even plays with them. They are a big part of our family. I hope this helps you with your decision. They are both about the same noise level. When choosing a parakeet look for a young one. (the younger the eaiser to tame) Look for clean smooth feathers, beak, and clean vent feathers (the feathers around the butt..dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy) Look for a dark eye with no circles (the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes). Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird. the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older.
