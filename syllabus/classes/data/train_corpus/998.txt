This place is awesome, with a great ambiance and cool d√©cor, and the food is scrumptious (and especially their signature banana split). Sure, some items are a little pricey, but c'mon... have you ever been out to eat in Seattle before? I've only had good experiences at Adorn, I was greeted and offered a refreshment. I highly recommend Debi, she does an amazing job, I "love" the way she cuts my hair, extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect. I always leave loving my hair style. Best Chineese food in the area The food here is fresh and hot out of the Wok. The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty. The lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about $6. It is busy every day at lunch for a reason, the service is fast and the food is great.
