#2) If you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you $8 per item. #) If you want a late checkout, (after 11 AM) they charge you $15 for the first hour, $25 for the second hour, and after 2PM it's a full day charge. #4) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM. No earlier and no later. If you go later, it's all cleaned up. (By whom, I don't know. I never saw anyone there. All these rules are posted in the rooms.) Snacks: uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't exist. I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
