The classes cover all age and skill ranges, with BALLROOM, LATIN, SEQUENCE, STREET, DISCO, LINE DANCING, BALLET, TAP & JAZZ. We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening.... It is not really possible to score this school too highly, We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne I purchased a 2-year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership. The night I drove back home, I found that the rear window has some leakage. (You can hear the wind while driving on highway. Very likely it needs a new window seal). I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive. (But this is a certified car from a dealer.) So I brought the car back the second day.
