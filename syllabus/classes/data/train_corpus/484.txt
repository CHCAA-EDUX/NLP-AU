Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched. If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms. Thanks again for your help with this project, Marianne P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16. I will start up again in mid-July... John: I have faxed to you the form of Bond, our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master. I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e-mail. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com
