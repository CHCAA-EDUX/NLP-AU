The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting. However, we waited and waited and in the mean time, saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names. This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “no reservation, sign your name here”. I had to ask the greeter, he explained his reasons with broken English. I could not understand any his reasons. I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first. My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you. Instructor never showed up! January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday's 2 PM class "Beginning Yoga with Brittany." We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests.
