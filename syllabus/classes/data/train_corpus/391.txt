Board members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO Forum on Thursday, September 13. Because of an international medical convention ongoing in Washington at the same time as our meetings, the Grand Hyatt unfortunately is already booked. However, we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. To reserve one of these rooms, you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group. If you should decide to arrange lodging at a different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in all surrounding hotels. We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to members of the DISCO Forum on July 20. If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please contact Hope Duncan at 202.739.0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703.729.2710. We are looking forward to seeing you on September 12.
