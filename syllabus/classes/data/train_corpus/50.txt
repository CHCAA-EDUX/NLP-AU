Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym, therefore opening him to cross-examination by Wilson, the prosecution had a problem. They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson. Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C-4 to Quaddaffi. The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the 'Office of Naval Intelligence'. Wilson had been able to show that he'd had more than 80 "non-social contacts" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971, leaving the prosecution's case in turmoil. Then Charles A. Briggs came to the rescue. Third ranking CIA officer, Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd, 1983, that on November 8th, 1982, he had authorized a search of CIA records "for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th, 1971, when he retired from the CIA." The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972, Wilson did not work "directly or indirectly" for the CIA since retiring. http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id334/pg1/ Last week, Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston, Texas, threw out Wilson's two-decades old conviction.
