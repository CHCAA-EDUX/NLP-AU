(I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews...) Friendly, clean and excellent location The staff was very helpful, and gave us good advice on day and night time activities. Common room was comfortable and clean, very good room to read or relax. â€“ A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30am; yummy fresh Parisian croissants. Comfortable and clean beds, a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out, but we didn't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out! The location is really stellar! It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping. It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza, Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again.
