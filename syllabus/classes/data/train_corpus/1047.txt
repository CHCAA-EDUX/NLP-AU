I'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place, because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer. Super nice people, really good food What I love most about this place, other than the food, is that eating here makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than Baltimore. The owners are really nice, they serve good food at a good price, and the option to eat outside on the deck (esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic) is great. One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore. Overpriced This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille, so I imagine they are owned/operated by the same people. The food is mediocre at best, and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality. Don't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there. I have ate here 3 times since they first opened, and the service has been poor each time, the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow.
