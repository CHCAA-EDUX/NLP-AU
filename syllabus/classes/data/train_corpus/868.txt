You MUST apply, to become a Immigrant, and WAIT to be approved, by the Canadian Government. YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history, combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record, and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration. It is a competition, and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, from all over the world, for a place in the line up. IF you have NOT begun the Application process's NOW< you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada. So don't pack your bags ,yet. Whatever you do ...............DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission. You will not be able to seek work or take a job, in Canada, with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer. Being an American and from the "south " you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud . Do it properly, and legally, and you will be OK. Jim B
