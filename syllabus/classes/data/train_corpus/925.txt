Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding. You can tell when your king snake is about to shed, because its eyes will get milky looking. Its body will be dull looking, too. In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin. For example, some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter, feeding mainly in spring and fall. It's natural and so long as you don't see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about. You see, some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food. They're fit and healthy and their care is suitable. hope this helped. That's why it's good to have a python!
