Took a bite, it tasted odd. Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold!!!! Ugh!! I called the store and the clerk giggled, and agreed that it was gross, but said it was not her problem. She also refused to get a manager. I left my number, or tried to anyway. Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number. I'll never go back there again For cheap Chinese food, this is the place to go. I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy, MO - nothing terrible but not that great.
