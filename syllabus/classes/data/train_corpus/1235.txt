They are also quick at getting your order out to you. You don't have to sit and wait around forever like most places!! So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things---You won't regret it!! and you will go back for more!!! Karla Ferguson-Granger PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends" and I will tell you that I don't know these people except from eating at their restaurant. We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago. So that comment is completely false. Because we think IT'S THE BEST!!! and we don't know them except for eating there.
