Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me!!!! She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls! She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her!!! She is caring, punctual, and very enthusiastic about her job! You should give her a try - it's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting!!!! Worst Service I've Ever Experienced I wish there was something good to say about the business, but unfortunately, there isn't. 1) Service and manners were nonexistent. 2) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. (to both myself and customers) 3) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business.
