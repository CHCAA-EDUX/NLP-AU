Maureen Philip, I have to decline the invitation with regrets. I have too many commitments right now. Vince Kaminski Dear Vince Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia, which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress. I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852 2545 2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.
