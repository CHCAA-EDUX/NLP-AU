Look inside yourselves parents, is this you? Probably it is. Fuck you. Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to "get a break" . You made a choice to be a mommy, you dont get a break until they move out, thats the choice that you madea and that's life. Tough shit. Just because you're stuck, doesnt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you. Another time I'll segueway into all the fun work related instances where "Mommies" get out of doing work and hiding behind childcare as the reason. This is the insidious conspiracy I call "Mommism". It must be stamped out.
