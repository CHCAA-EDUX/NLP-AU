My dental surgeon, Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established. Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back ..... Peter Wonderful service for large group I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant, and it was one of the best choices that I made. It was a great deal--we paid a certain amount per person, and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted. We were also served salad and soda. We had a large party, about fifty people or so, and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time. Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza, when guests asked for a different type, it was brought out with no charge to us! I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service.
