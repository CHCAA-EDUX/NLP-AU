1. The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be a lot more money). Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer. 2. The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question. In order to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000. In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached. I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI. Based on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI. 3. I expect at least one EPC contract per project. We don't want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project. Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project.
