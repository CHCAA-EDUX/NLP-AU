Is Fujairah a nice place to live in? My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years. So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways. Also that, I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai, is it true? I'd be happy if someone helps, especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there. :) I LIVE THERE! ... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way. I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012. Things to do in Fujairah.. Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains!
