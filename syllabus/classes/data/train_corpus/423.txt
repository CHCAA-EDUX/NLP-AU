Sam & Stephanie, Re: Cargill Ferrous International It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name. Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc." or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".
