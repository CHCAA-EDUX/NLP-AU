The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college, but you need to work hard. Absolutely the best little motel on the coast! I've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running, and I have to say it's one of the best lodging experiences I've ever had on the coast...and I'm even comparing it to the big resorts I've stayed at! A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend, and the experience and stay have always been five-star. The rooms are SO clean, the managers/owners are the nicest people, the place feels so homey, and the location and grounds are beautiful. There's a restaurant nearby (walking distance) with a great breakfast, and a market across the street. The motel is very well maintained, and the managers are so accomodating, it's kind of like visiting family each year! ;-) I honestly can't rave enough about this place...it's really a hidden gem worth checking out! My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando I have been eating Cuban for a long time, sandwiches mainly along with other dishes..
