If you do add all the entities, does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL? With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement. Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue. With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review. Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey, another paralegal in our Group. Denis O'Connell 11/22/2000 06:05 AM Tana - can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of. Tks,
