Please respond to request below. Thanks. John Lavorato has requested the attached report. He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories- in particular, Real Time Traders. If you would, please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening, if possible. I'm at xif you have any questions. Thanks! I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k. This is pretty easy math for me. I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.
