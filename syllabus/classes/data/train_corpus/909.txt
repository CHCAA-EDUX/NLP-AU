I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks. I will give them and call and see what they say. Thank you for the help. Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time. Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days. I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated. To answer your questions in order: 1) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it. However, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines. He could also have Parvovirus, a GI foreign body, or any number of things.
