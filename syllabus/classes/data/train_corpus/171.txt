oh god is there an agenda. Wednesday doesn't work for me. How about Tuesday's at 3:30 Houston time. i completely agree. I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1-2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything. My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task. What do you guys think. John OK. I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday.
