he has been drinking water (i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl, but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn't ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down.) i handle him every few days. he is feisty, as most king snakes are, but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything. i just love him to death. i don't know why he won't eat though! i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen (thawed) pinkies. i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is. i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won't touch the pinky. he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them. he doesn't seem to know that they are food.
