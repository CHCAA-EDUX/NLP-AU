I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA Program. In the end, the results were not favorable. I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability. After talking with you and Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance. I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year. I plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test. Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business. Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT. I know that with my industry-wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.
