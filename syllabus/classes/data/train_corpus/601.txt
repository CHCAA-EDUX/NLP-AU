Whereas, trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process. Feel you're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness, and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you. You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness, a dot in the Infinite Consciousness, is merging with Infinity. Continue for as long as you like, then open your eyes. OK that is fairly basic :). The important point is to develop some psycho-spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness. Don't worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that's normal. It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought. The main thing is to keep practicing. If you don't practice, then nothing happens.
