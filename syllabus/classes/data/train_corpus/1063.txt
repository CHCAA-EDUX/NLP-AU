Very kind and reliable. I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service. I have since purchased two cars from this dealership, The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard. Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first. This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie. I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker...and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me..."the inspection guy isn't here today"....for example. Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection...but I was still out of there pretty quick...barely had time to read a chapter in my book. Extremely helpful and professional As first-time home buyers, my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty, extremely helpful. She worked with us for over a year, helping us find our perfect home.
