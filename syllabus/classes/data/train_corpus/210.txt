Hi... Talked to the little mother-to-be. She said a shower would be grand. She has some big presentation mid-January. How does late January sound to you. Should we set a date now? Am I turning into Mother? Cindy I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery. On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.
