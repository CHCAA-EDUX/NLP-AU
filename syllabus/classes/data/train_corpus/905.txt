I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops. Because I don't feel like spending over $20 on a freakin DVD I also have back problems that transfer into my legs. I have done Yoga for riders for a while, a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube (I think its called "Yoga for horse back riding" hosted by a man) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back. Here is what I do now and it really helps.... When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena. Then the same thing with the other leg. Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can, so they are not touching the saddle. Then a lap doing scissors, one leg forward as far as I can and the other back, then switch legs. I'll also trot doing, down 2 beats, up one for a wile, then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet.
