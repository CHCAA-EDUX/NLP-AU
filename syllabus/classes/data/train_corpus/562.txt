I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason. Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used. That said, the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :). I'm nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions. Regards, Humanpixel Aye! Good Day Mate! Im really looking forward to Guild Wars. Anyone know a release date?
