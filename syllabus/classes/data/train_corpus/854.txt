It was an evolution. Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid-80s. We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s. We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then. We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted. Only Caucasians had any political power, corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods. San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers. There has always been a Mexican-American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico. We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected. San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically.
