I am just south of Walnut. She says, Is that 17th like over past broad. YES, I am west of broad. Broad, I say, is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut. Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad? Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's. Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem! B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June. They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence. Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!".
