she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn't now. she knows she is invading someone else's territory, but can't help it, and has no where to go. she will be able to sleep without being afraid. as well, your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened. when the door opens, he will get that the one room is hers, and he will be OK with that. the territory thing will be solved. your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey. this is not good. give them time to set up their territories, and once you bring the new kitten out, pay a lot of attention to the male. you have brought someone else into his territory, and he needs to be reminded that you still love him, and support his claim to his space.
