Sara: We need to change the Prod Description fro the LME Product. The change is mainly on the Settlement Date text, which instead of "...Two business days after the date of the Transaction..." shall read as follow: For Curr LME LME (Spot) 01Mar01 JPY/USD A currency Transaction with Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited ("EEFTL") as agent for Risk Management & Trading Corp. under which either (A) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from EEFTL, Counterparty shall receive the Base Currency Amount and shall pay the Foreign Currency Amount, or (B) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to sell to EEFTL, Counterparty shall pay the Base Currency Amount and shall receive the Foreign Currency Amount. The Base Currency Amount shall equal the volume submitted by the Counterparty via the Website. The Foreign Currency Amount shall equal the Base Currency Amount, multiplied by the daily London Metal Exchange (LME) fixing rate as published by Reuters on page MTLE on the date of the transaction, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty via the Website. The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website. The Settlement date shall be the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website. The price is quoted in JPY (the 'Foreign Currency') per US Dollar (the 'Base Currency').
