Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated. That's kind of the way it goes..lol. Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring. If you have limited options, try the bathroom. Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often. Depending on the batch of kittens, I will often have as many as one per kitten. They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy. For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop. Also if they have diarrhea, check in with your foster coordinator. They made need medication or deworming or something.
