Pure Pilates!! It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else. It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others. The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients. I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end(as our building contractor carried out the electrical work), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor. Thoroughly recommended They really go above and beyond! For example, I actually forgot to feed my cat, and they went out of their way to take care of him. Additionally, when there was confusion (my fault), they left me flowers along with a personalized gift. They have been 100% reliable and professional.
