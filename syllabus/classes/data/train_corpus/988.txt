Down to earth and fast service. Going back to have some lab coats done this weekend! We love Little Farmer We attend LFTD and our children LOVE it!! They even want to go to school on the weekends!! They are preparing my older son for kindergarten and looks forward to seeing his teacher and friends everyday. My infant is content everyday when I drop off and pick up. PAT testing quick & efficient I rang SRD PAT testing and within 3 hours Scot had come to my premises and PAT tested all my our Spill The Whisky barn dance band equipment, and supplied a certificate for only 70p per unit. Fantastic, quick and efficient service.
