I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I've been a nervous wreck and haven't been behind the wheel. Unfortunately, a family emergency required me to conquer this fear. A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry. She highly recommended him and described him as the "Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is ....very calm, pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions". I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package. I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson. Five minutes before my initial lesson, I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready. My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus! I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn't feel comfortable driving an SUV. Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why don't we give it shot.
