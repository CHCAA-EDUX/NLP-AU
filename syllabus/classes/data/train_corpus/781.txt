I'm looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to's. We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I'm not an expert on the area. A little help is always great. =) Thank you or your feed back. Oh my, you asked this question at the perfect time. Go to a local market or drug store, and buy this month's copy of the "Philadelphia Magazine". It is all about this very subject ... bars and food. It lists places all over the city and suburbs. Wishing your husband a happy birthday! If you're looking for a good burger, some great fries (they are too die for!), and good drinks, go to Chickie & Pete's!
