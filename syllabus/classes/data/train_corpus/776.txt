It doesn't matter how graceful your horse is, or how high he can jump, or how well he does a sliding stop. What matters is how well trained he is, and how good your bond it. That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also. Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week, then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good. YOU have to spend the time training. And I have not met one stuck-up trail rider! Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding, competitive or not. Same, when I'm galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything. Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal. I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer.
