After that, I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car. I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods. For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true. I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing. The Worst Chinese I've Ever Had This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had. The service stunk. I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses. They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again. They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $10 more than what she had wanted.
