He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight. Since then, I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him, stop every few hours for water, and their trailers all have super smooth suspension. All horses I've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive. I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote. Even though you may not want to use them, it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair. See link below. Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded/insured and knows something about first aid. Do they have this anywhere? I want to take a cruise around the world. I mean literally around the world if possible.
