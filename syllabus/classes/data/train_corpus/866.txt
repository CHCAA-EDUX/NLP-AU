Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen/thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run. My opinion - take it for what it's worthâ€¦ :-) Looking to move to Toronto? I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area. Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock. Any suggestions? Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine. You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street, right downtown. It is full of gay friendly "everything". But, you could live where ever you fancy takes you.
