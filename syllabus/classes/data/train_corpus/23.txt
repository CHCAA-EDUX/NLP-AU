They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas, last March. Worse for Israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites. These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's regime, but have now organized and armed themselves. They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites. It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals. Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas, and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine. Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan. Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception. Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize. An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel.
