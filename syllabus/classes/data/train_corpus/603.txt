Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration. Furthermore, the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration. (Since the Declaration is written as coming from “religious leaders,” people who don’t consider themselves “religious leaders” can sign as “Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality.”) Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage. If you have any questions please feel free to call me (after Sat. the 26th, when I will return from a trip). Sign-up lists will be available at the services on Feb. 27 and March 6, or you can email me. I will email names and email addresses (or postal addresses) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their “lobby day” in Raleigh on March 15. Thank you for your consideration of this issue.
