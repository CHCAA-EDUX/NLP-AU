The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three-phase Chinese space initiative, Johnson-Freese said. The first phase, she said, will demonstrate the capability of a multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth. The Chinese program's second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques. The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer-duration space lab. At least one expert believes China's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA's planned lunar return. "The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly," said John E. Pike, director of the Alexandria, Va.-based GlobalSecurity.org, a small national security think tank. "There is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look like we are not numero uno," Pike said. During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War, NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays. As it turned out, the Soviets never made it to the moon. "(China) could be the second country to do that," Pike said.
