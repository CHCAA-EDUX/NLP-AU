700f jobs aren't advertised. That means making yourself known; that means networking. why does my baby king snake refuse to eat? i have a baby eastern king snake. i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses. he has a great environment, with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp. as far as i know, everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned. according to the vet, he is healthy and looks good. he has been going to the bathroom like he should. (i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won't eat.)
