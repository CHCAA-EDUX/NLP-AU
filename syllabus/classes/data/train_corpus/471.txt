Jeff David Hoog 01/26/2001 09:37 AM following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's authorization to enter into the agreement. these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements. the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract. in our case, they are only hedging.
