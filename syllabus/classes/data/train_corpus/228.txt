Hey Cester, When are we going to get NetMeeting going ? How is Deb's knee? Did she ever go to a real doctor? [Tholt, Jane M.] YesShe is having physical theraphy 3 times a week. She said it is getting better. I haven't seen her for a couple of weeks and have only talked to her. I will probably be calling you next week-the desk wants me to become more involved in regulatory updates so I will seek your assistance with this matter. Jared just told me you have a BUNCH of stuff on your plate and I think you are about to get much busier too.
