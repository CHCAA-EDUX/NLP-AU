Virginia, Hello. I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph. I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston. They should be delivered this week. They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection. By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent. I have also purchased an Appel in the last month. I am interested in several artists. Actually, a lot.
