I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon. I have finally found a mechanic I trust!! And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus!! Dr. Shady Kelly hit the nail on the head. "Dr. Shady" is a jerk. After the way she spoke to me on my last visit, I will not be returning!! Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady. You have just lost mine. The next time you feel like being condescending to someone, it is not going to be me!!!!!!
