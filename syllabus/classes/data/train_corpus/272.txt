Unfortunately, Mr. Lay will be in San Jose, CA participating in a conference, where he is a speaker, on June 14. Rosalee Fleming RE:??? June 14 Reception Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be held at the Houston Petroleum Club. I hope that you will be able to attend that event. Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education system. The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to improving education in Texas. I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th.
