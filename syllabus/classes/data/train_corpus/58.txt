Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on-the-ground intelligence, and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands. One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region." Considering the islands' huge strategic importance, it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been. These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca, through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia. Intelligence lapses As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in, Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny. In recent months, its fallibility has become evident. The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka, and the recent "coup" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure. With growing economic and military power, India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security. Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations.
