Beware of Sharayu Hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised. Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint. My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont!!! Course has come a long way!! HCC's new nine was a little shaky at first, but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course!! The comment below definitely needs to be retracted! Come back and give HCC a second chance at least! It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive!! Excellent Physiotherapists!
