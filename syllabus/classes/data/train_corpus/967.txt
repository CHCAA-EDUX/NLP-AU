I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail. The reason he said he didn't put that nail in was because he "didn't want to risk it" with my horse's horrible feet. This is about the fourth time they've done my horse's feet because I just switched back to them. The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own. However, he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS(now that's what I call a crap farrier). Which, I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails. So, obviously I switched back to these guys. Ok, calm down, it's not like he's some stranger that came up and groped me lol. I've known the guy for about 10 years. I am 21, so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other!
