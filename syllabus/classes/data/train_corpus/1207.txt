If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle. Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together. I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac. Wish this was in Saratoga-- We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler-professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world-- and residing in Paris,London, New York the rest of the year. SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES. She was dead on-- this restaurant was wonderful--- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page. I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent. Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food. This chef knows what he is doing.
