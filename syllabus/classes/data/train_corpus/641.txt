Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast. Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many, many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean." As the Pew report concluded, "Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U.S. ecosystems." Such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems. The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage. The Alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "being a net source of CO2 (releasing more carbon than is stored) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2." The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "Arctic Climate Impact Assessment." The ACIA -- with participation by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000. "The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic," said ACIA chair Robert Corell. "The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth.
