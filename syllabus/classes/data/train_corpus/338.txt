I'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems. I believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for PUTS that 's causing this whole issue. I'll keep you posted. Karim - this's likely the explanation to your other question... I'll get back to you as soon as I have more info (hopefully later today) Marcelo L. Meira Sr IT Developer Enron Networks - Houston, TX (713) 345-3436 The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608. I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money. Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts? The liq value for the call is CORRECT.
