I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone. You will not be disappointed!!!!!! Outdated but not bad So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern. It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels. The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together. If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else. Great, and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville. I was born and raised in Toronto, which has a huge West Indian (Trinidadian, Jamaican, etc) population. So huge in fact, that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references, and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria.
