Kent Grusendorf State Representative District 94 ? This is o.k. for Ken Lay, but we are changing to a more uniform address, so would likely be better to use kenneth.lay@enron.com. This is a "test email send" of the WPO Forum Group from Richard Everett. By return email, please verify that you received this message and let us know if there is another email address that you prefer us to use. Thank you.
