(He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners). Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality, that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg, so that he could stand out, being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as Jane and Linda did. This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore.... He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness. Besides being a murderer, John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern, trauma from which he never recovered. Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him, he made lyrics such as: "You can wear a collar and a tie, one thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside" and gave declarations to the "Rolling Stone" magazine saying that "sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man". The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism. One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono. That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be. When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade, John said in a despective manner: "ah!!.. in Sweden..", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike.
