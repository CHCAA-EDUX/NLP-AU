"A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic." The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod, haddock, saithe, herring, blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster. Important species that probably would decline include shrimp, capelin, Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish. Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate. The IPN report examines commercial fish species, but it neglects important non-commercial animals, such as seals and polar bears. In a limited economic sense, therefore, the organization can argue warming might be a good thing. The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables. The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument. They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy. This tug-of-war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans, because animals and plants can adjust only so much.
