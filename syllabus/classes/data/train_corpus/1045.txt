Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food. But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern. If you are a handcraft beer person, this is a fantastic place to be. Perfect Location plus I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it's been a refreshing change. I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare. The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I'ma bit surprised by other comments. She's very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests. Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit. great service/deals - support this local business
