Check out The Willow Lounge, youll be happy! Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema. But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food (think lots of meat), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant! And, I can say, this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond. Amazing! Don't let the nondescript building entrance fool you, these are some creative and talented chefs...two thumbs way, way up! Excellent food, fantastic wait staff I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser's. We had 30 guests for the event, and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food, but the outstanding service as well. The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages, and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless.
