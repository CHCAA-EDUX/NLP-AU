Guess what, was not in the initial agreement as well. I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track (from 2pm-8pm). The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, I should admit, nothing was broken. So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially. One more thing, they don't take any credit cards or checks. You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination. Worst Apartments EVER We lived here for 2 years, the first year or so was okay. Then, the more power they gave to Linda, the worse the place got. We were always having our water shut off, there were always people having parties at the pool, even after it was supposed to be closed.
