Don't waste time, just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek, they actually do try to help their customers there! ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES. IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE, MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI. SO, IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES, WELL, IT IS OK. IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD. IF YOU WANT A STEAK, WELL, THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY. OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK, THIS IS NOT IT. Eulogic Good place to be on a Sunday Night. The beers were good, nice choice of beers as well, and as usual the mussels were great, the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs.
