And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch. a parakeet is friendlier Parakeet. They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them. They are also friendly. I have a parakeet named Cookie . :P When is the best time to travel to Ireland? My sister and I would like to go to Ireland. I graduate in the spring, and so we'd like to go between then and winter. We don't want too many tourists, and since we'll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November.
