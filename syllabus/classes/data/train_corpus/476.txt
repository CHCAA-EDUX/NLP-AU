There were only 15 minutes left of class. I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived. I told the bus driver where to drop her off. I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure. And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe. Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well. Thanks. Jeff Jana Giovannini
