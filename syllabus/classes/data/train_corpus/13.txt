The tape was a way to signal priorities. These are 1) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani military "president" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al-Qaeda sympathizers. His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, as well as nearly 500 other al-Qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US. Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, MMA. MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province, which probably shelters Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province, also on the Afghanistan border. If al-Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers, they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts. They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power. All this is highly unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes. But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan.
