Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times. Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that. Later do it again. When the dog is ok with this, then open the door and walk around the crate, leave the door open all the time. Put something fun inside. Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason. Do not shut the door. Let him walk in and out for a few days. At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all. Open the door and let him out and see how he acts.
