Carol: I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form. Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review. Please note the following as you review: 1. The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility. 2. I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers. If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so. 3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past). Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs). Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of "saving space" than anything else...
