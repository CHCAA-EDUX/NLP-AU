I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon. I love the people, the product and the service! Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time. - The Brick, Ikea, and Leon's have their place. But furniture like this will truly be around forever. The internet here is terrible. Like the previous poster said, the com lines are split between the entire building. That's 3x worse than Qwest DSL's lowest speed offering! The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice, but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap. Moving out as soon as our lease is up.
