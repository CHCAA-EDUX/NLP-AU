They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help. Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail, the location is surprisingly quiet. I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety. The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and other stores. The well-equipped, clean gym is a plus! Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose! I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel. Liberty construction shows up and it's two guys...all I get is 100% sales pitch "We're the best...we're number 50 so we must be doing something right...look at all these certificates that say we're great". Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted, all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there. Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service.
