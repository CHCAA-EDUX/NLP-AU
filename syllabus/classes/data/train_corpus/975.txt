This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn't be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price. I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3, that is not me to clarify. She is the one that can't afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn't recover fully. He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can't eat regular hay. I don't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain. I am not going to go pick up a horse I can't afford. I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat. The owner is the one who is unable. I will also be having my other vet up who's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers. July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury.
