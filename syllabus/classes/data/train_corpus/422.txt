Best Rgds. Samuel Tana, Please review the process below: With divisions, EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below. When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID. Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems. Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see. Thanks, Stephanie
