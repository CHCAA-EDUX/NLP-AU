But like i said nothing ever came of It.. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up.. I was heartbroken.. but then realized He was not the Guy for me.. Wow he does sound interested in you, my farrier never gives me hugs like that (probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids) anyway, I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don’t leave a message so you don’t have to necessarily wait for him to call. From the point of view of a business, and client/operator relationships, he's doing a really shitty job. Leaving nails out so you'll call and have him come back out later? Cute or not, I'd call a different bloke because he's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at, whether he's flirting or trying to ask you out or not, he ought to put quality first. This is, after all, his business, and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work? EPM, Anyone Dealt with it? Might be something different? I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free.
