I will attach the letter explaining the benefit we are sponsoring. There is a link to the contest page. Any help in distributing this will be greatly appreciated. It is certainly for a good cause. Abby needs to fly to New York twice a month for these treatments, and her time on the Federal Grant program has expired. She doesn't have the funds to continue without the grant, and without these treatments, her prognosis is grim. I hope you have a huge network. Also encourage your recipients to forward this along to their contacts, and so on, so that the movement to help her grows exponentially. We must finish in first place in order to contribute the $5000 to the benefit fund. Thank you so much for caring enough to offer your help.
