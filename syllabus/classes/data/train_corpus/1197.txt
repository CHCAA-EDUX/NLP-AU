The cashier was also short, unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time. There were no other options available (I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy. I will not be visiting Mama Mia's again. There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more. DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS, THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES. IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES. ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS. ALSO, THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR. NEXT, THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD.
