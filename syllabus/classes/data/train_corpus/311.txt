Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D) The play was very good and I think well received. I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY. The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling). I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!). Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl. As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia). Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went. I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling. So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?
