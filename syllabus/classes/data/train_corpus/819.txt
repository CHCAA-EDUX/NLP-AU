thanks louise I would say it really depends on your riding ability, what disciplines you are interested in doing, or plan on doing, etc. But I would go for the base number of 15hh. It's "tall" being it's bigger than a pony, but it's on the small end for a horse. I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5'9-5'10, thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5'11" but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3hh, TB. So don't be afraid to get something a little bigger than "perfect" just in case you hit a growth spurt. A taller horse doesn't always mean a horse you can't handle. Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground, if you even need to, etc.
