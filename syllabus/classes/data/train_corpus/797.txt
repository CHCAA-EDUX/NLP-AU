Gaining and loosing my cockatiel's trust...? I thought that I had gained my cockatiel's trust, but now he's not coming to me when I open his cage. What do I do? Did anything happen before losing his trust? Birds are hard to gain trust with, but it's lost so easily! A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you. Eating by his cage and keeping a "sleep cage" in your room is a good idea. Birds eat and sleep with their flock, not predators. Keep his cage open and go on your computer, or read a book, etc and maybe he will come out to you. Let him go at his own pace, don't rush with him, and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird.
