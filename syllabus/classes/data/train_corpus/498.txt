Are you back in the office yet? We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/Houston. Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket. Paul and Judy are on board. Can you and Tom join us? Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell's broken leg. Please call me, let's discuss. Thanks, Kim X33098 John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.
