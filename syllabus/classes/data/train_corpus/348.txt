Jeff: FYI, we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with Sue and Robbie et al. They indicated they could use Steve's help face to face at some point. We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues, case law and MSA self-certification language, and let me know if you have additional items. We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the CPUC. Let me know what schedule works for you. Also, can you confirm the correct names, email addresses, titles for those new folks on Friday's call: Robbie Rossi, Michelle, Melissa Lloyd? Thanks. Jeremy Meier Blumenfeld & Cohen Attached for your review are draft talking points for the Cal Energy Markets conference I'm speaking at on Thursday in SF.
