But word of advice if you're get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL, Acer, Asus, eMachines etc. just a heads up. yes of course you can.... I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question. How do I take care of my newborn baby fish? I am nervous that my other fish will eat them, and I don't know what to feed them! I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank. You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish (also the parents) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten. Feed the babies 3-4 times a day with flakes.
