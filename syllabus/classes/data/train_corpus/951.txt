You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights, insurance, food, accommodation & spending money. Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe. Golden Wonder KilliFish Breeding Help? I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish. 1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long. 2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4-5cm long. The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long. I feed them Flakes, and Live Earthworms uncut everyday. Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies? Thanks in Advance.
