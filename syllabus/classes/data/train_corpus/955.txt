3. Is there too much mineral in the water? Aplo. lineatus are wide-spread over southern India. That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries. Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS (total Dissolved Solids) test, that may give you a hint. Winging it a little here, a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM (parts per million) or 5.8 to 10.6 DH should be fine for gardneri. TDS meters (the thrifty aquarist's hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department's annual reports. They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron). A number of minerals are not of much consequence. However if there is a high level of sodium chloride (common salt) that can break down the chorion (shell) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo.) Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
