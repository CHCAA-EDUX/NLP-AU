Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck. I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have had most of my women. I really need to engage brain before articulating! I am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before rain. One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account. Dow Stock is back up over $33. Hooray, hoorah! Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy. I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place. We need to change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.
