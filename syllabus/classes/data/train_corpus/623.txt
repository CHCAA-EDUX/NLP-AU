Continue pre-fab crap. WELL GUESS WHAT!!! Within seven days, I started getting money in the mail!! I was shocked!! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $1000.00!! In the third week I had more than $10,000.00 and it's still growing!! This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of $42,000.00 and it's still coming rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00 and six stamps, and I have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning!!!
