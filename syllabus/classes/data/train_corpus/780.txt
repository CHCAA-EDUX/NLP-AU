Have fun! Judging by Nook Tablet's processor it's supposed to be quite faster!

Hey there, I'm trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday. He's pretty much an "I love American Food, good drinks on occasion, laid back." kind of guy. ;) I want to take him somewhere where there's going to be awesome burgers/american food, atmosphere (preferably a tavern/pub style would be nice), good service, and all around a great time. =)
