I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone. I've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes, like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait (depending on what other patients are being seen for) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly (just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance)... I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration. I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us (the patient) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you. I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice...Warner Family is the place for you. Not what i expected! We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes.. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way! ~It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table, once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table. Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied, once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention. Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely.
