While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least some of these special guests. If you have any contacts who could help us get in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com. Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak. There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well. Those requests should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our colleagues can be quite a task! Thank you all for your participation. Dale, Confirmed. Vince Vince:
