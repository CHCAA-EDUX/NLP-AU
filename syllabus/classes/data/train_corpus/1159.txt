These guys were the best. They were thorough, high class, and went above and beyond. We never had to worry about a thing, and they led the way the whole time. They asked us things that we would have never have thought of, and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding. Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time! They may look young but don't let that fool you, as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected. I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's, and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's. So we didn't expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night. They just really know their stuff! NEVER fear going to the dentist again!
