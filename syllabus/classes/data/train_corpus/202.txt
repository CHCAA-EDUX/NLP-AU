Expect a call from Paul tonight. Chris What are some good interview questions? Poll your co-workers. cd I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality. Chris Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive?
