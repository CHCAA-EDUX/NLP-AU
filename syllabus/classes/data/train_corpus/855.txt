The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s. EDIT: My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time. Can rabbits and chickens live together? I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet, but my parents said that it has to stay outside. We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage/barn thing. There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens, but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night. However, in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens? We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but it's nothing that a rabbit wouldn't be able to digest just fine. So, can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water? (The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit, the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food) Also, is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed?
