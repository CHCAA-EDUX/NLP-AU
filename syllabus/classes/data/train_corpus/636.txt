Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states, including Colorado, Utah and Oregon, among others. On Jan. 31, Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them. He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf's status. Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision. Regardless of the wolf's legal status, its future expansion into new areas now seems likely. Wolves can migrate considerable distances. A Yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a Colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home. Meanwhile, his reputation seems to be improving, although Bangs noted a "pretty interesting social dynamic." There are only about 850 wolves in the West, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions. Pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves.
