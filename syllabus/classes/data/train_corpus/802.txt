Yeah, I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong. No worries, i didn't try. He does have toys, a scratching post, LOTS of mice, balls, yarn, a feathery birdy toy, etc. He'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting. When i put him off of my bed, he jumps back on and same thing. he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped. maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way, hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys. lots of them, feather ones work best, also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed, to show him that you will not tolerate that, he will get it, hes also probably teething, so toys are your best bet Which rat cage is better?
