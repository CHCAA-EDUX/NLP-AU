It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney. It was a 7 lb., 10 oz., 20 inch little boy. So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days. They are a great deal of fun. We are doing quite well. I am looking forward to seeing Ginger "Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston. I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston. I hope you have a great summer. Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference. Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.
