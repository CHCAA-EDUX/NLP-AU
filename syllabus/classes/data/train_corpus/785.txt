2 Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip. Laser grips are the most common for wangs. The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on. Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip. You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions. 3 Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi-automatic wangs. Newer semi-automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft. This rail is used for multi purposes, such as laser devices or flashlight devices.
