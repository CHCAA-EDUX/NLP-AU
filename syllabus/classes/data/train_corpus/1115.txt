Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon!!! I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years. I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair (style AND color)! I regularly request Kim's business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "Who does your hair...I LOVE it!!!" Quaint, lovely, small salon with BIG personality. I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience. My hair has never felt this healthy, either. I cannot recommend this salon enough!!! Thanks Cheveux! My Favorite in McLean
