Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires? I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me. Patrick Hansen@ENRON 07/17/2000 04:28 PM Michael and myself are planing to be in Hoston on Thursday and Friday of this week. We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL implementation. We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others. We would like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually. Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with more than one of you in one place. Thank you
