Good luck! Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines, typically 100 days in duration. Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy. No possibility to customise ports of call. Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London (England), England to Barcelona (Spain), Barcelona to Alexandria (Egypt), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc. yes there are multiple around the world cruises, mainly offered by the more upscale lines. HOWEVER: you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin, even if it is just you. so any price you find, DOUBLE IT figure, $40K at least. and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore.. say book a Panamal Canal crossing, then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing. Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s?
