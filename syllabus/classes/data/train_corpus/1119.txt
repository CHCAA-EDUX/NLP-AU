Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up. And non-smokers beware!!! I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers! If you do not smoke, do not move here. Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in. You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night. Great Sanwiches, Great Prices I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches. Chicken salad salad is great too. Best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in 5 minutes or less.
