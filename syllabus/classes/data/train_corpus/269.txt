Thank you again, Tori L. Wells Executive Secretary Hi - Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work. I want to check with Mr. Lay before confirming. Thanks. Rosalee Dear Ken, As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from 3:00-5:30 p.m. In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.
