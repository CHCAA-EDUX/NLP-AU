How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number? We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more? Thanks: John Buchanan Here it is. K. See the attached spreadsheet. Let me know if you have any questions. Jan, These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.
