Vince- Good news. Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday. This was (another) nice deal for Enron. We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone. I'm happy about this. Clayton Iris, Congratulations. Anne, please, include this info in Iris' file
