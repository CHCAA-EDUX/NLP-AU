Try the local sake too if you can. It's a special kind. I'm not sure that there's much nightlife in Naha. It's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather, the sea, etc. You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya (pub) somewhere. Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa. Naha's not a very big city. Modern m16 vs Vietnam m16 version? I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model, and in the game it's 3-shot burst. My brother said they only had full-auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam.
