I can't believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI. I'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup, that's for damn sure. :) I'm a regular poster but for some reason blogger won't let me in today...but sign me TroubleFunk. Tronicus: Simply, the questions permeate the entire 'Western (Mystery) Tradition' and perhaps 'Eastern' as well, as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality. For example, is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process? Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation? Similarly, is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system? In my opinion, people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems. The 'high weirdness' and more hardcore political 'factions' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis.
