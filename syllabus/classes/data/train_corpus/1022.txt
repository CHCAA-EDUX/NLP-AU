I choose Console Pros and I'm happy I did. This place is bad. It's dark, dingy & dirty. The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn't any better (ok, the nachos are not too bad!) This place may have been something sometime; but it way past it "sell by date". I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it. Top range of bike, cheap prices, excellent a+++ yep they fixeded my thumpstar in 1 day. it wasent going an had a gear box problem.... i coldn't find anywere else local to fix it so i took it there and they fixed it for $150...
