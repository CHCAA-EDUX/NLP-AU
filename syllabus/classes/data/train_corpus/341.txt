I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money. Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts? The liq value for the call is CORRECT. John unable to attend at that time due to a prior appointment, I can meet with you individually later some time OK, now that I've got your attention - I really am offering free lunch! I would like to informally get together with you on Wednesday, July 18 at 11:45 am - 1:00 pm (max) to talk about your recruiting experience with Enron Canada. We're gearing up for our 2001/02 recruiting campaign and we think your experience will help us define what works best and what can be improved in our process. For those of you in Toronto, I apologize for not being able to schedule this over your lunch time! However, if you can wait til 2:00pm to eat, go ahead and grab something and expense it!
