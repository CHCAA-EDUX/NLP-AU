The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz, which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving, flawless picture. To a dog, watching T.V. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz. So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them. So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T.V., it’s probably because of the sounds. Hearing is a dog’s secondary sense, and I will discuss that in another blog entery. Yes they do. im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen How much should I be looking at for horse transportation? I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live. The place where I'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
