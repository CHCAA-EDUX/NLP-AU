Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore. Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels. Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003? please print Amanda Huble@ENRON
