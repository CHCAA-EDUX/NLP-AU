I am a college student. Before treatment, my food cravings were "out of control" which caused me to be stressed out. I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving (about 50%) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment. I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment. I was amazed. I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99% gone after only 3 treatments. Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend's aunt recommended it. It hurt very little, felt more like pressure than pain. What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring. She talks to you at each appointment.
