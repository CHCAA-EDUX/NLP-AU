I'm unsure of this, because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn't react to seeing another cat on TV. I heard that a company (here is a link: http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs, complete with squeaky chew-toy sounds, and high pitched sounds that humans can't hear. As far as I understand, this ad will get dogs excited, but my question is: Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans? Also, can animals remember images on TV like us, humans? If so, then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog/cat/parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared? I wouldn't know--I don't particularly like scary movies, and I haven't tried this with my pet. Although, I don't think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time; I am sure they'll forget sometime--or am I wrong? So what about T.V.? Do dogs enjoy watching T.V.? Well, T.V. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture.
