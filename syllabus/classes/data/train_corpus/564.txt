Check out the Guild Wars Web site at for more info about the game. It's a massive multiplayer role playing game. The graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days. It's worth a look. I have a preorder and am even considering getting a second preorder to have multiple accounts. I have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world preview. The game is already 100% functional. I can't imagine them not being able to meet the Feb 05 deadline. Warm greetings to all in this GW community. I am Lady Kingel and I hail from the United Legit Gaming Guilds of Guild Wars.
