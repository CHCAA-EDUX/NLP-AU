Ok--fine. So I got just my other rear tire replaced. They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby. Over two hours later (and ten minutes before they closed) my car was finally finished. A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car). Of course, they would be closing in 5 minutes, so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day. Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me). The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in. Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat). On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
