I'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake. I normally don't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers. It's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right. Highly Recommend I work as a Transformational Life Coach. Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate. I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide. Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well! She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member's suicide, coupled with elder abuse. I found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well.
