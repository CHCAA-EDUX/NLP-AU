As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen ours). Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP (the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract. What say ye? none Susan Rance@ENRON 11/28/2000 03:58 PM By Friday December 1st, could you please tell me the percentages/amount of time you spent on East Coast Power during the months of October and November. In addition, could you look over the list below to see if there are any additional employees in your group that spent time on ECP, so we can ensure we bill all of our used resources to ECP. Thanks for you cooperation. ***Mary Perkins - Could you forward the number of transactions and accounts.
