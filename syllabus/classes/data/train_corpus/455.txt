tks Sara Shackleton 09/16/99 09:48 PM Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines (physical and financial) for the London traders. I am trying to develop similar guidelines for the Southern Cone regions (first Argentina) and thought your expertise would be very helpful. Could you send me a set? I'm leaving for Sao Paulo on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow. Thank you for your help. Regards. Sara
