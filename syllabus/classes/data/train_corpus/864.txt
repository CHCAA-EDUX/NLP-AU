Once you're holding it, try to get her to touch/pet it... My Snake's meal is TOO big, what can I do? Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar (name after Harry Potter). Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily. But today, I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE! I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold-blooded creature. So my true question comes to this, how can I knock the rat out? If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away, do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull? I really do need answers and advice, and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS!! LIKE SERIOUSLY!! >:(
