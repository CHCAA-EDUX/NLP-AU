Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in. We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of. We heard nothing. We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing. I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship! She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?" Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!! YES! I WAS calling about one board!! I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
