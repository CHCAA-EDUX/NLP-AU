Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday, but also was able to immediately take care of me. He was incredibly informative about the options I had, giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from. Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general, Dr. Taylor was the best! He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service! I would recommend him to everyone! HORRIBLE This school is the worst one i've ever been to. I attended it for 2 years, and that was enough. There's holes everywhere in the ceiling, sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling, and the whole condition of the school is horrible. The staff and the Principal are rediculous, they don't listen to any input, and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks, because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student's).
