The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic.. I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice. Holly is truely the best hairstylist! I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years, and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here. I was very pleased with my experience here. All of the people were friendly and welcoming. I got highlights, haircut, and a blowdry. She did a great job! Holly is very experienced and talented, and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat. My hair looks amazing, and I get compliments all the time.
