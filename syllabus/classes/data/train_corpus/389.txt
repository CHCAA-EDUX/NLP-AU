I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM's spies intercepted. She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him. Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response. As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers. Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation. Yea--it was outstanding news! What a hoss. Can't catch you this time but 14721 keep me posted on your next trip. DF Evan --
