I would recommend her highly! They won't have a second chance from me. First, let me state that although I live in NYC, I am not from NYC, I don't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death (so beautiful, so clean, so awesome). That said, I hated this restaurant. The service was just about as good as I'd get in NYC (that means it was poor) and the food was almost mediocre. The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality. Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner. I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda. Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle.
