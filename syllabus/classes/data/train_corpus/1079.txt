If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired! Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives! Best Car Dealer in TX I purchased a nissan from this dealship. The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at. They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork. The paperwork was a very easy and smooth. They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won't hurt my score. Overall, I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase. If you're looking to buy a car, definitely give them a call.
