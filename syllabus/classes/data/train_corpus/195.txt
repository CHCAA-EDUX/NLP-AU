Figures, of course. Thanks for asking. I'm watching for some good vacation days, also... fyi/review/comment I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI: We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment. Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic? Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft? I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one. Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?
