My last rabbit did that a few times, and he was fine... I just wanna make sure :) Thank! Yes,but be sure that your chickens are all hens(I mean not roosters),Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving,so be aware of that,hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets! From my experience Hens(Not roosters) are very friendly with duck,Guinea pigs,kittens,cows,Rabbits,etc. Be sure not to feed your rabbits non-veg items! You said they live in different cages and they are free in day,so no problem,don't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens,wet bedding can cause diseases in them! So,don't put both of them in one cage. Good luck! yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender. So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens.
