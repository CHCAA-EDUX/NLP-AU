If the weight is going into your heels (it throws your leg forward) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot. Do a nice working trot, not a slow trot. All this will help you use both legs evenly, keep proper contact and use your wight correctly, to keep your leg in a good position. BTW you dont want your leg locked in place, it will move WITH the horse a bit. When I first started doing it I'd do it every day. Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed. Now not only is my leg better, but my back is relaxing. what are you having problems with? i wouldn't bother with yoga i'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem, ride bareback, with no irons, theres also a way to ride on your knees? that help alot with your thigh muscles (bareback though)
