I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body . Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation. Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for. . Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor. I know I wouldn't. You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital. Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too? Sometimes the "cheap" comes expensive! When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections, accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too! If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now!
