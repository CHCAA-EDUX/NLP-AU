Barbara Quimba 1/30/10 the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat! I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis. I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her. I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager. I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog, I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention. We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying, " was I gotta have it!" I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier. Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer. Definitely go see them!
