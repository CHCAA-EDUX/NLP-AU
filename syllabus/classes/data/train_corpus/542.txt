Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else, remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny. No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier, we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality. Fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective bad behaviour cannot continue indefinitely. In the near future collective choices will need to be made. Will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard? Will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger? There is no health without peace and no peace without health.
