Janice Moore 09/03/99 01:57 PM Here it is -- we printed this 2-sided and laminated it. Becky will bring you the hard copy version. Lunch date later. see below. It looks like the 2-day L/C issue is an issue. I'll call you shortly. Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight.
