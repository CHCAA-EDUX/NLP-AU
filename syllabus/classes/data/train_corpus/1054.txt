Consistantly poor A lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency I have used. Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in (many of them still unresolved as I left) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after I left. . . . as soon as I could. If you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then I would. AMAZING NIGHT- Great Party Spot!! Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks...place is awesome. Had to keep in mind that the A/C broke, I feel bad it was their opening! Anyway, once that is fixed, this place will be amazing. Drinks were awesome, prices reasonable, and staff friendly. This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs.
