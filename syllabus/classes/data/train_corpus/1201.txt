Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides. 10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF. I have purchased over 15 vehicles (cars, rvs, and boats) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best. Friendly, knowledgeable, and above all fair. That's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3. Thanks for the great deal and the great car! Identity Theft Myself and my fiance's identity was stolen from the office staff. We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual. Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us.
