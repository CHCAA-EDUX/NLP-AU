Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly. The waiting staff is beyond impeccable (they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom). If you want great food then L'espalier is the place to go. I didn't end up buying my car here, but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me. Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free, even if you didn't buy your car there! The Best Deals in Town Before you buy ANYTHING in NY, make sure you stop by Jack-s first. Their selection is random, so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store. I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances. Trust me, you go there once and you-ll always go back!
