Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. If you have questions or issues, please let me know. Thanks
