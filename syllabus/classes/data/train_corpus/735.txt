What cleaners can I use to dust around my budgie. Would pledge be ok? If not, what is? Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don't require cleaner. If you must use a cleaner, pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated. I have had parakeets for a VERY long time, and I use pledge. Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate. I agree w the answer from Nothing. Even a cotton cloth (I like diapers) that is barely damp w water will work fine. Swiffer or any type of micro-fiber cloth is excellent.
