Can I text from Canada to the united states? Ok maybe that isn't the right question, but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada, can you send texts to another united states number? And do you get charged for it? Im sorry if I couldn't say the question right. I hope somebody understands what I mean In short Yes. However not in all cases. If your (US) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company, you texts and calls will go through. They will, however, cost a bunch. The only way to know for sure is to call 611, or your cell phone help line, and ask.
