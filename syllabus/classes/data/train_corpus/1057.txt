I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service. It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly-accented English. The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people. We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act. I recommend them highly! DONT ever go there, not even if your car flips. Their service sucks to start off with, people are cruel and ignorant. I'm compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products. They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS, they will NOT take it back! DO NOT EVER GO HERE.
