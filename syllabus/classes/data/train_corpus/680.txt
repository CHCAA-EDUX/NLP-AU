In the Beatles' song "Get Back" they advise black Joe to "get back to where you once belonged", as if England was not a place for black people. Sometimes back, Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people, but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles. The Jewish marriage living to the right of George's house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting. The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George's house (Friar Park) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from. The receptionist of "Hand made", the former film making company of George Harrison said: "we don't have any relation with that man anymore and we don't want to know anything about him". It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison, who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him. Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other. Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing. George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon.... George Harrison said in a video that "Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn't be playing at all", all of it being the truth, but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis.
