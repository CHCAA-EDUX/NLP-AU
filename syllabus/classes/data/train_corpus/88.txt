I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law. Of course law enforcement has dragged it's feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves. Personally I don't give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled. It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me. Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life. In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband. Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time. a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world. It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child. The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure.
