All were awesome, & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers. After my sampler & sandwich, I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout, I must say I was impressed, with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me, I think this is better, its less dry & smoother! If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out! The only negative I have abou this place is the parking! I left with a case of BRAWLER!!!!! Oil Change Disaster My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change. A couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly. Turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter. There could have (hopefully doesn't have) major damage to the engine.
