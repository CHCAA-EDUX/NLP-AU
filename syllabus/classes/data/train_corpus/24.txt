If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves. That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites. Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians. Ariel Sharon's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence.
