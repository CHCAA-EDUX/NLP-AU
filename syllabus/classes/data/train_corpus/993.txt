It has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time, the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area. Good beer good service and what more could you want. awful awful awful This store is by far the worst Verizon store I've been in. The salespeople are never available, the lines are always too long, and all the people want is a sale. Incredibly rude and I will not return to it. Is there no other Verizon to go to around Downtown/Dupont Circle1?!?!? Great graphic design work!
