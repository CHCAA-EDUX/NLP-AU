The worst Burger King restaurant!!! I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants; however, I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town. This is a shame of my adorable town, Branford. I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already. I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay. Disgusting french fries is very best menu. Don't go, or you will learn how to waste your money. Disappointed The Bad: I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food. We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes.
