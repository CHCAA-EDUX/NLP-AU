The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract. It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend. Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation... We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm. BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties. I am going to count it as signed, since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC. Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me. Much thanks. We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000. This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement.
