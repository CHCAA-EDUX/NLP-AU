Change of boarding station? How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter? My origin Station is Howrah, but I want to board at Asansol.. Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah? If yes, you don't need to change it because you board later. If no, you'll have to go to one of the train stations. In Calcutta there is a Foreigner's reservation office where they speak English very well. I don't remember near which station it is though. They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones? Even if you don't find the foreigner's office you'll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station.
