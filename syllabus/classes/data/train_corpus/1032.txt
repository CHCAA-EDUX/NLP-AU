Not good, not great, and again another disappointment in Central Iowa. How do these places stay in business. This town needs some food soul and this is not it. Worth Every Penny My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night, and our experience was amazing. Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection, and was presented perfectly. The asparagus, seared tuna, and lobster tail were the best we ever had. Then the desserts came, and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had. I will sum it up with, it was worth every penny! BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!
