Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following countries to the non-approved list: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia. Below is the list, now updated to reflect this change. Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives: Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S.. Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands. For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches). This would have to be determined on a case by case basis. Please let me know if there are any changes to this list. Sent by: Nella Cappelletto Yes, we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and/or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act (Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) and Securities Act (Ontario). Thanks,
