What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you. She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she doesn't want to go further. If she is nicer when you are alone I'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend. You do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts. Unfair for the girl as boys don't have that kind of handicap, but that's the way our own rules work. Should have done research before you left. Why not just take your chances and do it your way? True or false: being a young New Zealander means having no future? There are no jobs in this country. I'm just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry.
