They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved. We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them. lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash. In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash. I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil! I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals. I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them! Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated. Okay, here's the scoop. I'ma regular at the HH.
