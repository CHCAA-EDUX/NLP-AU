She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead. We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order. Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull. They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up. We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible. I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that. The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable. I will NEVER go here again. Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal. I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote.
