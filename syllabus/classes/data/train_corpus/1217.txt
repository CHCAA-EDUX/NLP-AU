A mid-afternoon "fire drill" was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel. When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down. The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again. Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here. My experience was awful though. It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks. I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal. Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back. I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.
