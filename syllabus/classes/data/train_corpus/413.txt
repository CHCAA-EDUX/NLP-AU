When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID. Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems. Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see. Thanks, Stephanie Sam & Stephanie, Re: Cargill Ferrous International It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name. Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc." or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".
