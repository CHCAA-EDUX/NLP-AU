My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate. I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way, it wont work. He wont even get close to the crate. If I come towards him, he will run away. How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate? and to willingly go outside...and to come on command. He wont do anything on command. Its very frustrating. I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy. I trained her myself.
