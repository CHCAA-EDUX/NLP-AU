"Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change," said Camille Parmesan, a University of Texas-Austin biologist and one of the world's leading experts on this issue. These changes are occurring across all species, Parmesan told UPI's Climate. "Across the United States, the northern edge of species' range is expanding," she said. Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly, which migrates between Mexico and southern California. Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat. "Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver," she said. "There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable." According to Parmesan's earlier studies, one extinction event, for instance, was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely, relying on a warming temperature signal, then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat. Throughout the United States, she said, "spring is about two weeks earlier. Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier.
