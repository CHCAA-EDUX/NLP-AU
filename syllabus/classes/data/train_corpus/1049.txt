They interviewed me, gave me tests in the software I included on my resume, and placed me in a position that I kept for several years. Re-interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job. I'm really thankful for the folks at HR Office. They are dependable, have great connections in the community, and are a great resource for finding a job. I highly recommend them to all of my friends!!!!! Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder! I adopted a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League. The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding. If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don't forget to check out the shelters! My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family!
