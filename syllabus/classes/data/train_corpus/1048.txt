Apps 4 Salad 3 Entree 3.5 Wine 5 (NOV 07) Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. Wine was excellent. I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again, I'll definitely order a steak. A perfect place for a romantic dinner. Lots of "pretty people" dining inside. Great staff. Very helpful!!!!
