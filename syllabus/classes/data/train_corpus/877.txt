Mine learned to "go to the bathroom" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch. The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat. That means expense, space, and they require weekly cage cleaning. My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats (at least mine wasn't) but more so than most hamsters or mice. Again, pairs or trios and pretty big living space. They, too, need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit. I could handle my mice, but they where skittish and preferred their cage. I've never met a hamster that didn't bite me. Never had/handled a Degu. Get a guinea pig.
