From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia. Bilboa on the north coast, Pamplona and the very famous Guernica. A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland. I've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget, actual time allowed, your likes and dislikes. Amount of time could be dependent on so many things. Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place. Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place? You need a lot of money for hotels, airfare, seeing the sites, food, local transport - you name it but life costs. Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you'll be able to figure out where you can go, for how long you can go and what you can do when you're there. 1 year before collage or college?
