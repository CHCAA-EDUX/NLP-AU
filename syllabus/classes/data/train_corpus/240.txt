Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office? That would be particularly convenient for me. I will have to leave downtown at about 945 to catch a plane. That will ensure that I wont take up too much of your time!! Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient with me. Dale Nesbitt FYI Vince sold! I'll initiate the call. Ed,
