This language has been included in the attached draft. My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end of today. Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day. Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written. Otherwise, I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning. Thanks for your prompt attention to this. Thanks, Gregg Gregg Penman 10/23/2000 12:12 PM
