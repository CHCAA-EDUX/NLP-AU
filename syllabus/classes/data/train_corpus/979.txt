We've had a few since then, but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida. I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers, but we haven't had an EPM horse in at least 10 years. I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing. One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM. We've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1/2 mile. The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after. It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns. I don't know. MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here. You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study.
