I'm mad and don't know what to do! Please help!? Alright, so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it. (I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again) so I fineally checked it, and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida!!! I got so excited!!!! It said it was in January but still!!!! So I kept reading and then I saw the dates, it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday. :( then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates. (we live in Pennsylvania btw) I'm mad and upset now! Don't get me wrong I want to go, but for 2 days -_- I mean seriously.
