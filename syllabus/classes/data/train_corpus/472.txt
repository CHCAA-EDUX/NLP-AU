we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front. therefore they will not attempt to make this claim. even if they did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout. the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back. seems like a 5 second decision to me. is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form? by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way. please print RusAmArts@aol.com 01/26/2001 11:57 AM
