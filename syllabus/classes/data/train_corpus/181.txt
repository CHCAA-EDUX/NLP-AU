Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company. Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else. The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg. 80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc. This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger. Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items. 83N is my responsibility. I think this entity should stay with 83N. So I suggest it be assigned to Leon. It should be 4 - easy.
