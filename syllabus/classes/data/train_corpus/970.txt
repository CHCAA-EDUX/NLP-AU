He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids.. but we both flirted Horribly with each other.. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date. :( sorta wonder what it would have been like? But That was Years ago. He had this Habit of telling you Everything.. Well one day he said to me You know i don't wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof.. and I was Like Ummmm okay??? Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn't see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing..
