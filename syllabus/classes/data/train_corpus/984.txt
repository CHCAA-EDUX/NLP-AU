Good and Bad I had to take care of the ants myself. But I found the location wonderful and the neighbors very kind. Never had a problem with the staff and found them very helpful when something went wrong. Loved the pool and BBQ. Because of the ants I dropped them to a 3 star. Great pet care I have used Just Like Family several times now and they have provided great care for my two dogs. Lynda is professional and has great compassion for animals. The real testament is not in how much she likes your animals but how much they like her.
