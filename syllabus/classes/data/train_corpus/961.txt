There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates. You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking........ Off season is good, however, the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked. I would suggest a warmer season, but not Spring Break or early summer. You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays. We REALLY enjoyed our balcony-- coffee in the mornings, drinks at night, standing outside when docking and leaving port-- however, it is quite a bit more expensive. With young ones, I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside. Check out the kids' space as soon as you get onboard. Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there. They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there, the sooner they can have fun.
