Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Samuel x3-9890 (GCP) Enron Net Works _ Global Data Management Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name? Hello, Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems. GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously. (Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename.
