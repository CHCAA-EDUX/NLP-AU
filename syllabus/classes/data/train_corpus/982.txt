Do not go to this salon, especially if you have to get your hair straightened. They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn't work for my hair. Rude, insensitive, discourteous people!!!!! Great Doc Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor. He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs, he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable. My neck is fixed!. He knows what hes doing.
