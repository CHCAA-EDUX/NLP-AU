"The bear gave chase and I gave chase," he said. "At some point, Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back. I was beside the bear's head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times." The bear ran off. While there was some fur and blood on the nine-centimetre blade, Dr. Fortier said he doesn't think he hurt the bear badly. Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon, however, were bleeding badly. Dr. Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River. Dr. Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement. Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived, though Mr. Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular, Dr. Fortier said. Dr. Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday.
