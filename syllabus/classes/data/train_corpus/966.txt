So, I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;) Anyway, so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message, but he still hasn't called back yet. I don't know if I should call him again tomorrow or not? I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you, but it's different because I'm a client and technically that's all I am at this point. On the other hand though, if I'm a client he should really of called back by now because you don't leave a customer hanging. He didn't have my number either because this was the first time I've called HIM instead of his dad. It's a father and son business. Anyway, I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all. Thank you for reading if you did! :) Ok, well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case, they are extremely well known farriers in the area.
