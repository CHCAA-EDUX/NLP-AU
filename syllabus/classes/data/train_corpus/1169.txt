VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond, Canal Walk, Carytown, Stony Point, Short Pump, and the VCU Medical Center. It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year. The U of R is also recommended, too! Orr's a nightmare! DON'T GO! My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who'd arrived around 1:00 am and were drinking at the springs. When we complained to the management (as we were instructed to do if there were any problems), nothing happened! Then, the next morning, when we, among many other irate guests, asked to speak to the owner, he refused to do so. Not only that, but he told us, via his manager, that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued, even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids. Orr is not relaxing, it's not a safe space, and the owner is awful.
