She is amazing. I would recommend her to anyone! So very delicious! Excellent! November 7, 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience. From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato, all was mouth watering. Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake. Maybe next time they will have it. Service was excellent! Sandy
