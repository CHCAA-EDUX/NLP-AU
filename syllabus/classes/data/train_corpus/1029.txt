You've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home. I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks! Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice! Beats having one "cleaning lady" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "maids" did! This place has the best baby and childrens clothes. Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores. It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff. I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess. Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it. Antique Lighting, Fixtures, Chicago
