We liked getting the late dinner seating, so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are 'early to bed' you may want the earlier seating for dinners. Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door. All of the doors tend to look alike and having 'something' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier. You can also leave notes for the rest of your family (husband) about where you are at any given point. Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a 'walkie-talkie' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard. Each evening you will get a 'magazine' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day. We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we 'had' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling. Any time would be great. off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season. My wife and I, in our 60's at the time, originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel.
