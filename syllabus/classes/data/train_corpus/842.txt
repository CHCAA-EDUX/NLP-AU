Comb Type: Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types (Rose and Pea) single is also there, but is recessive. So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut, pea, rose, or single combed bird. Five Toes: Silkies have five toes. Sussex have four toes. Crossed together (five toes is incompletely dominate) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both, or even one foot. Silkie crosses are great birds, and very neat looking. Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger, can see better, and are smarter the Silkies. Best wishes, Jamie/RhodeRunner I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000.
