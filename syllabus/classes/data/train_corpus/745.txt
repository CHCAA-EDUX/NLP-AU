Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently. For horses that are strong pullers. It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure. It's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle. I know that's vague, but it depends on the horse. The rider needs to have independent hands as well, because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that. ;) How long to save up for a canon t3i?
