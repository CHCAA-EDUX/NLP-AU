Do we need another one? Only if it is of the quality of That's Amore. The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch. The arancini di riso (risotto fritters) are not to be missed. Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven. Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree. Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used. The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed. The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had. They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services.
