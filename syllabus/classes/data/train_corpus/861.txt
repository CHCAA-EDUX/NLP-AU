To prevent animal cruelty, many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat. Switzerland is one, and the Netherlands are passing the same law. It will become EU law in a couple of years. We can't dictate what business wants to open where. If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places. How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python? They don't know ANYTHING about Ball pythons. When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house. She has no experience with snakes and has never held one. I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one, I'm 14 by the way
