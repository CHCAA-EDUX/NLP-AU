That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates... sheesh. Yes, it gives him the "sun rays" necessary, that's what UVA is. And it should be on 10-12 hours, just like the sun would be up for 10-12 hours in his natural environment. As for the heat, just be sure to use a thermometer. Also, Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so its anyone's guess whether or not he'll touch the freeze-dried crickets or the processed food. I tell all my customers they can try it, but don't count on it. Also try green leafy veggies, like kale and spinach. Best of luck! Is a finch or a parakeet better? I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like, and i was wondering : which would not bite alot, and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
