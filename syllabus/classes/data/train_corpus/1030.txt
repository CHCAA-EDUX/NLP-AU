Great place for Antique Lighting! I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW!! Lots of collections, many antique light fixtures, Chandeliers, custom lighting etc. I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago. Antiques, Vintage, Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers. I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago Great Food Awesome food Awesome service I wanted to try someplace new again. This place rocked. Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good..
