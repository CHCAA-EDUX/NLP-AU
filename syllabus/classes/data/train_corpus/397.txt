Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00. I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then? You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft. Thanks, Jean Jean & Thane -- Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets. Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes. If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood. As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market. Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.
