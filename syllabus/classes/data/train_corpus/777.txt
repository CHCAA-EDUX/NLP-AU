Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched. Fascinating. 10 gallon nano reef ideas? I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock, and 10 lbs of live carribean sand. I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size. I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1.024. I have a 10 gallon filter on it. I also have a powerhead, getting another soon. I have a few questions, first I want to start a sump filter, but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work. How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon?
