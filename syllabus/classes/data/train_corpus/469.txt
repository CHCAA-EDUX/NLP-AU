thanks for the update. have you gotten a price? Doug Leach 01/25/2001 09:40 AM fyi Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects. They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003.
