Then I sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray. (this way the will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol) Then I turned on the tv and watch. This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them. Do this for about one hour. (you can take breaks if you have too) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours. 3) After about day 2, they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand. (do not take away the food dish from the birds, they will associate you as the person who takes away their food).... Then take your finger and place it under their belly, in front of their feet and say up. Push you finger to their feet gently and say up. ( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you) They will have no choice but to go on your finger.
