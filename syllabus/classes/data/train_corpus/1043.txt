I enjoy going there although i've only been there once, i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here. i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality. Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people, and the minute you steep into their school, the calm loving atmosphere takes over, and tension and worries stay outside in the street, whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice. A wonderful place, if you want more than just the physical side of yoga. Give yourself the gift of trying this place, to see if it fits you... They don't seem to be interested in selling cars. Went there yesterday: we are trying to decide between two different Honda models, so we wanted to test-drive both back to back. The salesperson refused! Claimed he was too busy for two test drives. We were the only customers there!
