They want a program that will be a success," Johnson-Freese said. "They are not going to rush it, because they don't want it to be a budget buster. Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program." China's overtures to join the U.S.-led effort to develop the 16-nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues, including the Asian country's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat. The freeze thawed some after Yang's 2003 mission. China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA-sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush's strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other-deep space destinations. "We applaud China's space achievements," NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday. "We wish them a successful return of their astronauts." He stressed, however, that NASA would not follow this week's Chinese mission through formal channels. At present, there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership, Beutel said.
