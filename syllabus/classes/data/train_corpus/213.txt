David W Delainey@ECT 11/10/2000 01:04 PM Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M. We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well. Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal? Regards Delainey Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker. I just wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much). Thanks for the comment on the hearing.
