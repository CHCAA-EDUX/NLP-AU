The service is impeccable, and the food is even better. I highly recommend the four-course tasting menu, which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite. Also, if you are into wine, Alto has the depth of both region, varietal, and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier (or after 9pm, bring your own bottle for free...no corking fee!). While it's not cheap, Alto will give you an experience you'll never forget. The landlord is not nice nor helpful I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years. I love the location and the apartment!! I'ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night. The maintenance people are AWESOME!!!! And the exterminator is very nice, also.
