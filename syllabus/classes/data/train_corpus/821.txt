However, save some of your shots for the rest of the falls, as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River. The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and, dependent on your time restrictions and budget, you can get to the area by either bus or plane. The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina, about 12 miles from the falls, and Foz do Igua√ßu in Brazil, which is equally close. Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. The bus is obviously the cheaper option, and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours, although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats. The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours. Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town, however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks, and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets. For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget, there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls. Paris or England while studying aboard? I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I cannot decide where do you think would be the best place to go?
