As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE. Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities), I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service, that should be registered. I hope the above is clear.
