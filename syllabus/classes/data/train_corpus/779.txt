Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color? I don't want an iPad or Kindle. I just want an e-reader that does a little bit more than just read. Yes, I know about the Kindle Fire but that's not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars? Or just purchase the Color? Well I recently bought the Nook Color, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. It is like a mini tablet itself! When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet, I was pretty disappointed though, because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price! So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet. I'm pretty sure it'll be worth it.
