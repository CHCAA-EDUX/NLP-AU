You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not. French dating etiquette? I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this. I'm in my 20's and currently studying in France. Coming from an anglo-saxon country my version of dating is 'getting the number, asking her out, etc..' However, I've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different. For them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off. In addition, from my understanding one-on-one dates is something that comes much later and not 'straight-away' like us anglo-saxons. They are also very secretive about being in a relationship. They only 'go out in the open' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness.
