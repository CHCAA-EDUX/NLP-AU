nasa funding Comments Log in to add a comment Subject: Re: NASA IS A WASTE! From: saem_aero-ga on 26 Oct 2004 18:11 PDT Excellent answer googlenut. Let me add some additional info. You can get details about NASA spending here, from their own webpage. Also, from their own webpage, reasons why NASA is important, in a 5th grade format. I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy-ga. Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently, crossed a modern bridge, flown in an airplane, recieved any form of modern medicine, did any mathematics, drove a car, used a cellular phone, etc. then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us.
