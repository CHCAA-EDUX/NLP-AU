If you push it, it will never work. With going outside, put the leash on and just take him for a walk. He will learn to really like this. Potty outside will come at some point. Try obedience classes. Have patience with him, you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home. where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices? will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta. I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great. Should I just settle and book on line?
