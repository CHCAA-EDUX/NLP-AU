His fellow judges love him. His family loves him. President Bush loves him. Yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court. But other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him. So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of Jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval. The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, to be judging the cases Bush is interested in. So there is a lot of hurry-up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval. There is an old saying that applies in this situation: "Act in haste, repent at leisure." Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
