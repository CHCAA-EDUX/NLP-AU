Best of all, there are no ads!!!!! Just previews and the main feature. Expect to pay full price, and the theatres themselves are on the small side. But if you like going to the movies, you should love Bowtie. The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays, you can get a beer in the lobby, and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card. A great cinema in a great location. Thank you, Bowtie! Craft Wonderland with History My first visit was so fun yesterday. I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things.
