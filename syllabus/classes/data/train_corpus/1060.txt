Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists. I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed. If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were. Highly Recommended We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff. The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal. Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in. We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it's worth the extra travel, as the care provided exceeds our expectations... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere. HORRIBLE!!!!! This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering.
