Never mind. No need to worry. I'm sure this kind of thing goes on all the time. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.... just go here, its simply amazing The Raw Story i count like 14 explosive headlines. Then, of course, there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case... Funny how some things are squirelled away by well-meaning prosecutors... Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy/network of abusers/satanic underground?
