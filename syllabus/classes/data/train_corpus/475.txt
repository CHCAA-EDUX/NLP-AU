I couldn't say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus. It was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus. On top of things, I had quiz at 8am. Which I then realized I missed. I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own. I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts. I called her grandmother and explained things to her. Pretty strange...aye. A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I couldn't do it. Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).
