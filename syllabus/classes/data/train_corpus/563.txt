Feb 2005 Feb 2005 is the projected release date, although Guild Wars is made by ex-members of Blizzard, so Feb 2005 could mean August 2006... Anyway, I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2/3 weekend events. Oh well, I'll get it when it comes out in Febuary. rumor has feb 05 on the calender. BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long. as far as pre order go to and they have a list of major retailers that carry it there are also a few websites that you could order it off of. and a good reason for starting this group....company firewalls lol ;) I was kind of curious, what exactly is Guild Wars? I havn't heard of it.
