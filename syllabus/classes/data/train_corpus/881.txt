They are testing out their claws and teeth. To some degree you can/should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately. But in the meantime, highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you'll be interacting with the kittens. Then take care of yourself. Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy. Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time. Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are. If you still don't enjoy the kittens, see what other opportunities are available. They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations.. sick, recovering from surgery, need a little socialization, etc. I find the adults are much easier.
