Internet Department is rude and insulting I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS" Wow, can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles. As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker. Stay away from this dealership!!! This place is a Rip-Off I brought a car in to have the "check engine" light diagnosed back in March of 2010. They said it was "plugs and wires" and quoted me $330 to do the work, including parts. I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way. Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank (1 screw) and the air filter canister (4 spring clips).
