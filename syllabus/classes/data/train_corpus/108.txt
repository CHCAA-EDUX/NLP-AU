In regards to death metal, the problem is, once again, a question of education, history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture. Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well? Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first 'death metal' artists. Tronicus, if you're still checking this thread: A bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and I apologize for my over-generalizations. My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists, of any religion. True believers are dangerous animals. I just get hung up on 'Christians', as they're the dominant form where I come from. Also, I'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses. It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.
