Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated, and you'll be fine. That tactic never failed me. What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female? i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ? if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks? A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred *mutt* chicken. There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie, so the offspring would vary in appearance. You don't say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can't say what color your chicks would be likely to be. However, I can say what features they would/could have. Feather Type.
