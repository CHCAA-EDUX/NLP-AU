We are a consortium of legit honorable guilds that was established in 1997 for DI and we are now adding GW to the list of games played. The alliance is a pretty straightforward one. It was formed to allow many different guilds who were all strictly honorable to come together as a family and allow them many people to game with. There are no other requirements other than we ask that members greet each new member and each new alliance and also feel free to post in any of the forums. We are also a group who is looking for members for our own select guild called ULGG of GW...which is a part of the alliance with the same name. We play in all aspects of the game and we hand pick our members. I would like to personally invite each of you to visit our website. You are individuals of quality, and in our alliance we seek quality of member over quantity of member. You will be asked to register, and then you should wander over to the Announce Your Arrival Section and present yourself. You will be greeted by many members of this wonderful family.
