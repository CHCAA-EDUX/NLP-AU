Must be nice having money!! I need 2 things from you. 1. I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to change it over to you name. What do you think? If that's ok, how do you want your name to show up on the title and what address should I use? 2. I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock. How many of Dad's shares do you have? Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working. I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June. I can't remember.
