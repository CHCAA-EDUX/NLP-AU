Living out of synch with nature is the great disease, from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness. We are only as strong as our weakest, we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us- playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager. When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down. When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do, not only are they hurting us, but they are hurting themselves. There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in. What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you. We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment, our rejection of the natural for the industrial, and our embrace of violence over peace. Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him. What are you doing to the least of the people? If we are all in this thing together, let's play nice.
