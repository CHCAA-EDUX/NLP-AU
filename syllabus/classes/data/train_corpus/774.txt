If you knew what kind of "meat" they put in canned cat food you'd understand this. I've had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food. When you read the label its easy to understand why. I've had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food. They have done very well and like the dry food better. It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive. Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you're paying for a high moisture content instead of food content. There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods. Read the labels for contents. Your cat will adjust quickly.
