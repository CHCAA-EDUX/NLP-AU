When she dances she makes the band skip. When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her 13 years to live. She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner) Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard. When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts. Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph. Her driver`s license says "Picture continued on other side."
