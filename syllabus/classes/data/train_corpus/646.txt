"As an American, I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the 'USA and Bush Bashers' that I am appalled at the number of 'allies' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions. What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system, a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem. You have seen the pictures. You people think it is race, but it is not. It is the welfare society that was New Orleans." --Paul, Atlanta, USA "I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush-Bashers; "Sorry chaps, but you did have it coming..." The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors. At least he isn't using this disaster for cheap political point-scoring." --Mac, Nottingham
