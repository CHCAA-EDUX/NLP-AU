I think this office has some serious billing practice issues! We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards, posters, etc. We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started. They have the best rates and GREAT customer service. On one order, we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state. They did that with no problem. I also appreciate their honesty. I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was. They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect. They recently surprised me a larger order.
