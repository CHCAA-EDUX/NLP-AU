The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office. It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful). Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor. Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for. Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor. The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn, but advertised all over NY/NJ, including Fort Lee. When the guys arrived (2 hours later than agreed) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $100 for them to drive back from your destination. That was not in agreement eather, but they realy demand it. And another $100 for wrapping the furniture. So totalling $212 just for start before any work started.
