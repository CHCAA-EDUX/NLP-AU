I have known this guy for a long time, but we've never been good friends or anything. He is my farrier (shoes my horses feet) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way. Well, almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty. He always hugs me when he comes, but he gave me at least 5 tight, long, back rubbing hugs while he was there. We were also just talking about my horse's crappy feet and he mentioned. "Well, if you ever just want to see me I'll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after." That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested. Right?? Anyway, so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot(I've never heard of a farrier doing this) and telling me to call him in a few days(first it was a week, then it was a few days lol) and he'd come back out and put it in. He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left.
