I wouldn't send my dogs there. I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010. She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets. Wow, really? With all the child predators out there, a busy road, cars speeding by...... and you are going to let some 4/5 year olds wonder around cause you're money hungry? REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whether they pay me or not, if their parents get into an accident, stuck in traffic, etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN'T PAID. Excellent service I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price, but I go to the Garment District for their service. Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that, but I find the staff more helpful than anything else.
