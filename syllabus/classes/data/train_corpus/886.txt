Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other. Are there any major differences between them? Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best. For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas. Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, St. Thomas, the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten. The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay, Puerto Rico, and Grand Turk.
