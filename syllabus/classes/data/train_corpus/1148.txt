Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well, I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work, obviously they do not! Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston, NY First let me start out by saying, that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road. I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston, as I live in Youngstown. I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life. There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman. I put my foot in the water and it was cool. He did warm it up. He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back. If the pedicure lasted 20 mins., that was a stretch.
