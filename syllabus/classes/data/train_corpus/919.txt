I also know that you don't get paid that much more in Australia than you do here. And it's not all about how much you earn, cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia. Try living in Sydney on a teacher's salary, then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago. You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia. It's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan. At the moment there's no interest, but that'll probably change. And they'll probably add interest to what you've already racked up. And they're working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back. At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they'll force you cough up. And all that time you're overseas you'll be racking up interest.
