# Class 1: The work stack

This class will take us through the work stack we will be using for Natural Language Processing.

Some of this will be things that are only relevant for this course (or in this programme, more generally), such as integrating UCloud with Github. Other things will be useful more generally, such as some best practices in python scripting and some Python warm-up.

Depending on how it goes with the setup, you can do the exercises in class, or do them / continue at home. Next week, I will upload solutions to the exercises and briefly present them (first ~15 minutes of the class).


## Plan for today

### Github and UCloud

- Integrating UCloud with Github
- Adding Github token and set-up script
- Forking the main repo into your own repo

### Python scripting
- Virtual environments
- Requirements files

### Warm-up exercises
- A few exercises to solve at home (string manipulation, counting words)
- Using command line arguments
