    "# Clasroom 7 - NER using BERT style models via Huggingface\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous assignment, you were tasked with training a NER model using a (Bi-)LSTM network in Pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture on Wednesday, we started looking at transformer architectures and BERT-style models. We ended the lecture by suggesting how pre-trained models can be *finetuned* for specific tasks, such as NER.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see how we can finetune a pretrained BERT-style model via Huggingface for NER. Don't worry if some of it is unclear right now; we're going to spend more time on BERT models next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point right now is to see how a *finetuning* pipeline differs from a model training pipeline, and where there are similarities. A secondary goal is to demonstrate the kind of performance increase we get from finetuning pretrained Language Models, compared to training a specific (Bi-)LSTM for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been freely adapted from Huggingface's documentation. There are lots of similar notebooks on their Github repo that you should check out - link [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/notebooks).\n",
